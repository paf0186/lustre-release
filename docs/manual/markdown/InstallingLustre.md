## []{.indexterm primary="installing" secondary="preparation"}Preparing to Install the Lustre Software {#preparing_installation}

You can install the Lustre software from downloaded packages (RPMs) or
directly from the source code. This chapter describes how to install the
Lustre RPM packages. Instructions to install from source code are beyond
the scope of this document, and can be found elsewhere online.

The Lustre RPM packages are tested on current versions of Linux
enterprise distributions at the time they are created. See the release
notes for each version for specific details.

### Software Requirements {#section_rqs_tjw_3k}

To install the Lustre software from RPMs, the following are required:

-   ***Lustre server packages*** . The required packages for Lustre 2.9
    EL7 servers are listed in the table below, where \<ver\> refers to
    the Lustre release and kernel version (e.g., 2.9.0-1.el7) and
    \<arch\> refers to the processor architecture (e.g., x86_64). These
    packages are available in the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository, and may differ depending on your distro and version.

      : Packages Installed on Lustre Servers

-   ***Lustre client packages*** . The required packages for Lustre 2.9
    EL7 clients are listed in the table below, where \<ver\> refers to
    the Linux distribution (e.g., 3.6.18-348.1.1.el5). These packages
    are available in the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository.

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------
      Package Name                        Description
      ----------------------------------- -----------------------------------
      `kmod-lustre-client-ver.arch`       Patchless kernel modules for client

      `lustre-client-ver.arch`            Client command line tools

      `lustre-client-dkms-ver.arch`       Alternate client RPM to

                                          installation. This avoids the need
                                          to install a new RPM for each
                                          kernel update, but requires a full
                                          build environment on the client.
      -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      : Packages Installed on Lustre Clients

    ::: note
    The version of the kernel running on a Lustre client must be the
    same as the version of the `kmod-lustre-client-ver` package being
    installed, unless the DKMS package is installed. If the kernel
    running on the client is not compatible, a kernel that is compatible
    must be installed on the client before the Lustre file system
    software is used.

-   ***Lustre LNet network driver (LND)*** . The Lustre LNDs provided
    with the Lustre software are listed in the table below. For more
    information about Lustre LNet, see

      : Network Types Supported by Lustre LNDs

::: note
The InfiniBand and TCP Lustre LNDs are routinely tested during release
cycles. The other LNDs are maintained by their respective owners
:::

-   ***High availability software*** . If needed, install third party
    high-availability software. For more information, see
    [???](#failover_setup).

-   ***Optional packages.*** Optional packages provided in the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository may include the following (depending on the operating
    system and platform):

    -   `kernel-debuginfo`, `kernel-debuginfo-common`,
        `lustre-debuginfo`, `lustre-osd-ldiskfs-debuginfo`- Versions of
        required packages with debugging symbols and other debugging
        options enabled for use in troubleshooting.

    -   `kernel-devel`, - Portions of the kernel tree needed to compile
        third party modules, such as network drivers.

    -   `kernel-firmware`- Standard Red Hat Enterprise Linux
        distribution that has been recompiled to work with the Lustre
        kernel.

    -   `kernel-headers`- Header files installed under /user/include and
        used when compiling user-space, kernel-related code.

    -   `lustre-source`- Lustre software source code.

    -   *(Recommended)* `perf`, `perf-debuginfo`, `python-perf`,
        `python-perf-debuginfo`- Linux performance analysis tools that
        have been compiled to match the Lustre kernel version.

### Environmental Requirements {#section_rh2_d4w_gk}

Before installing the Lustre software, make sure the following
environmental requirements are met.

-   *(Required)* ***Use the same user IDs (UID) and group IDs (GID) on
    all clients.*** If use of supplemental groups is required, see
    [???](#identity_upcall) for information about supplementary user and
    group cache upcall (`identity_upcall`).

-   *(Recommended)* ***Provide remote shell access to clients.*** It is
    recommended that all cluster nodes have remote shell client access
    to facilitate the use of Lustre configuration and monitoring
    scripts. Parallel Distributed SHell (pdsh) is preferable, although
    Secure SHell (SSH) is acceptable.

-   *(Recommended)* ***Ensure client clocks are synchronized.*** The
    Lustre file system uses client clocks for timestamps. If clocks are
    out of sync between clients, files will appear with different time
    stamps when accessed by different clients. Drifting clocks can also
    cause problems by, for example, making it difficult to debug
    multi-node issues or correlate logs, which depend on timestamps. We
    recommend that you use Network Time Protocol (NTP) to keep client
    and server clocks in sync with each other. For more information
    about NTP, see: [https://www.ntp.org](https://www.ntp.org/).

-   *(Recommended)* ***Make sure security extensions*** (such as the
    Novell AppArmor ^\*^security system) and ***network packet filtering
    tools*** (such as iptables) do not interfere with the Lustre
    software.

## Lustre Software Installation Procedure {#lustre_installation}

::: caution
Before installing the Lustre software, back up ALL data. The Lustre
software contains kernel modifications that interact with storage
devices and may introduce security issues and data loss if not
installed, configured, or administered properly.
:::

To install the Lustre software from RPMs, complete the steps below.

1.  Verify that all Lustre installation requirements have been met.

    -   For hardware requirements, see [???](#settinguplustresystem).

    -   For software and environmental requirements, see the section [
        Preparing to Install the Lustre
        Software](#preparing_installation)above.

2.  Download the `e2fsprogs` RPMs for your platform from the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository.

3.  Download the Lustre server RPMs for your platform from the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository. See [Packages Installed on Lustre
    Servers](#table.installed_server_pkg)for a list of required
    packages.

4.  Install the Lustre server and `e2fsprogs` packages on all Lustre
    servers (MGS, MDSs, and OSSs).

    a.  Log onto a Lustre server as the `root` user

    b.  Use the `yum` command to install the packages:

            # yum --nogpgcheck install pkg1.rpm pkg2.rpm ...

    c.  Verify the packages are installed correctly:

            rpm -qa|egrep "lustre|wc"|sort

    d.  Reboot the server.

    e.  Repeat these steps on each Lustre server.

5.  Download the Lustre client RPMs for your platform from the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository. See [Packages Installed on Lustre
    Clients](#table.installed_client_pkg)for a list of required
    packages.

6.  Install the Lustre client packages on all Lustre clients.

    ::: note
    The version of the kernel running on a Lustre client must be the
    same as the version of the `lustre-client-modules-` \<ver\> package
    being installed. If not, a compatible kernel must be installed on
    the client before the Lustre client packages are installed.
    :::

    a.  Log onto a Lustre client as the root user.

    b.  Use the `yum` command to install the packages:

            # yum --nogpgcheck install pkg1.rpm pkg2.rpm ...

    c.  Verify the packages were installed correctly:

            # rpm -qa|egrep "lustre|kernel"|sort

    d.  Reboot the client.

    e.  Repeat these steps on each Lustre client.
