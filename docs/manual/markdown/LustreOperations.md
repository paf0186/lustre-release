# Lustre Operations {#lustreoperations}

Once you have the Lustre file system up and running, you can use the
procedures in this section to perform these basic Lustre administration
tasks.

## []{.indexterm primary="operations"} []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="mounting by label"}Mounting by Label {#mount_by_label}

The file system name is limited to 8 characters. We have encoded the
file system and target information in the disk label, so you can mount
by label. This allows system administrators to move disks around without
worrying about issues such as SCSI disk reordering or getting the
`/dev/device` wrong for a shared target. Soon, file system naming will
be made as fail-safe as possible. Currently, Linux disk labels are
limited to 16 characters. To identify the target within the file system,
8 characters are reserved, leaving 8 characters for the file system
name:

    fsname-MDT0000 or
    fsname-OST0a19

To mount by label, use this command:

    mount -t lustre -L file_system_label /mount_point

This is an example of mount-by-label:

    mds# mount -t lustre -L testfs-MDT0000 /mnt/mdt

::: caution
Mount-by-label should NOT be used in a multi-path environment or when
snapshots are being created of the device, since multiple block devices
will have the same label.
:::

Although the file system name is internally limited to 8 characters, you
can mount the clients at any mount point, so file system users are not
subjected to short names. Here is an example:

    client# mount -t lustre mds0@tcp0:/short /dev/long_mountpoint_name

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="starting"}Starting Lustre {#starting_lustre}

On the first start of a Lustre file system, the components must be
started in the following order:

1.  Mount the MGT.

    ::: note
    If a combined MGT/MDT is present, Lustre will correctly mount the
    MGT and MDT automatically.
    :::

2.  Mount the MDT.

    ::: note
    Mount all MDTs if multiple MDTs are present.
    :::

3.  Mount the OST(s).

4.  Mount the client(s).

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="mounting"}Mounting a Server {#mounting_server}

Starting a Lustre server is straightforward and only involves the mount
command. Lustre servers can be added to `/etc/fstab`:

    mount -t lustre

The mount command generates output similar to this:

    /dev/sda1 on /mnt/test/mdt type lustre (rw)
    /dev/sda2 on /mnt/test/ost0 type lustre (rw)
    192.168.0.21@tcp:/testfs on /mnt/testfs type lustre (rw)

In this example, the MDT, an OST (ost0) and file system (testfs) are
mounted.

    LABEL=testfs-MDT0000 /mnt/test/mdt lustre defaults,_netdev,noauto 0 0
    LABEL=testfs-OST0000 /mnt/test/ost0 lustre defaults,_netdev,noauto 0 0

In general, it is wise to specify noauto and let your high-availability
(HA) package manage when to mount the device. If you are not using
failover, make sure that networking has been started before mounting a
Lustre server. If you are running Red Hat Enterprise Linux, SUSE Linux
Enterprise Server, Debian operating system (and perhaps others), use the
`_netdev` flag to ensure that these disks are mounted after the network
is up, unless you are using systemd 232 or greater, which recognize
`lustre` as a network filesystem. If you are using `lnet.service`, use
`x-systemd.requires=lnet.service` regardless of systemd version.

We are mounting by disk label here. The label of a device can be read
with `e2label`. The label of a newly-formatted Lustre server may end in
`FFFF` if the `--index` option is not specified to `mkfs.lustre`,
meaning that it has yet to be assigned. The assignment takes place when
the server is first started, and the disk label is updated. It is
recommended that the `--index` option always be used, which will also
ensure that the label is set at format time.

::: caution
Do not do this when the client and OSS are on the same node, as memory
pressure between the client and OSS can lead to deadlocks.
:::

::: caution
Mount-by-label should NOT be used in a multi-path environment.
:::

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="shutdownLustre"}Stopping the Filesystem {#shutdownLustre}

A complete Lustre filesystem shutdown occurs by unmounting all clients
and servers in the order shown below. Please note that unmounting a
block device causes the Lustre software to be shut down on that node.

::: note
Please note that the `-a -t lustre` in the commands below is not the
name of a filesystem, but rather is specifying to unmount all entries in
/etc/mtab that are of type `lustre`
:::

1.  Unmount the clients

    On each client node, unmount the filesystem on that client using the
    `umount` command:

    `umount -a -t lustre`

    The example below shows the unmount of the `testfs` filesystem on a
    client node:

        [root@client1 ~]# mount -t lustre
        XXX.XXX.0.11@tcp:/testfs on /mnt/testfs type lustre (rw,lazystatfs)

        [root@client1 ~]# umount -a -t lustre
        [154523.177714] Lustre: Unmounted testfs-client

2.  Unmount the MDT and MGT

    On the MGS and MDS node(s), run the `umount` command:

    `umount -a -t lustre`

    The example below shows the unmount of the MDT and MGT for the
    `testfs` filesystem on a combined MGS/MDS:

        [root@mds1 ~]# mount -t lustre
        /dev/sda on /mnt/mgt type lustre (ro)
        /dev/sdb on /mnt/mdt type lustre (ro)

        [root@mds1 ~]# umount -a -t lustre
        [155263.566230] Lustre: Failing over testfs-MDT0000
        [155263.775355] Lustre: server umount testfs-MDT0000 complete
        [155269.843862] Lustre: server umount MGS complete

    For a seperate MGS and MDS, the same command is used, first on the
    MDS and then followed by the MGS.

3.  Unmount all the OSTs

    On each OSS node, use the `umount` command:

    `umount -a -t lustre`

    The example below shows the unmount of all OSTs for the `testfs`
    filesystem on server `OSS1`:

        [root@oss1 ~]# mount |grep lustre
        /dev/sda on /mnt/ost0 type lustre (ro)
        /dev/sdb on /mnt/ost1 type lustre (ro)
        /dev/sdc on /mnt/ost2 type lustre (ro)

        [root@oss1 ~]# umount -a -t lustre
        Lustre: Failing over testfs-OST0002
        Lustre: server umount testfs-OST0002 complete

For unmount command syntax for a single OST, MDT, or MGT target please
refer to [ Unmounting a Specific Target on a Server](#umountTarget)

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="unmounting"}Unmounting a Specific Target on a Server {#umountTarget}

To stop a Lustre OST, MDT, or MGT , use the `umount /mount_point`
command.

The example below stops an OST, `ost0`, on mount point `/mnt/ost0` for
the `testfs` filesystem:

    [root@oss1 ~]# umount /mnt/ost0
    Lustre: Failing over testfs-OST0000
    Lustre: server umount testfs-OST0000 complete

Gracefully stopping a server with the `umount` command preserves the
state of the connected clients. The next time the server is started, it
waits for clients to reconnect, and then goes through the recovery
procedure.

If the force ( `-f`) flag is used, then the server evicts all clients
and stops WITHOUT recovery. Upon restart, the server does not wait for
recovery. Any currently connected clients receive I/O errors until they
reconnect.

::: note
If you are using loopback devices, use the `-d` flag. This flag cleans
up loop devices and can always be safely specified.
:::

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="failover"}Specifying Failout/Failover Mode for OSTs {#failover_ost}

In a Lustre file system, an OST that has become unreachable because it
fails, is taken off the network, or is unmounted can be handled in one
of two ways:

-   In `failout` mode, Lustre clients immediately receive errors (EIOs)
    after a timeout, instead of waiting for the OST to recover.

-   In `failover` mode, Lustre clients wait for the OST to recover.

By default, the Lustre file system uses `failover` mode for OSTs. To
specify `failout` mode instead, use the
`--param="failover.mode=failout"` option as shown below (entered on one
line):

    oss# mkfs.lustre --fsname=fsname --mgsnode=mgs_NID \
            --param=failover.mode=failout --ost --index=ost_index /dev/ost_block_device

In the example below, `failout` mode is specified for the OSTs on the
MGS `mds0` in the file system `testfs`(entered on one line).

    oss# mkfs.lustre --fsname=testfs --mgsnode=mds0 --param=failover.mode=failout \
          --ost --index=3 /dev/sdb

::: caution
Before running this command, unmount all OSTs that will be affected by a
change in `failover`/`failout` mode.
:::

::: note
After initial file system configuration, use the `tunefs.lustre` utility
to change the mode. For example, to set the `failout` mode, run:

    # tunefs.lustre --param failover.mode=failout /dev/ost_device
:::

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="degraded OST RAID"}Handling Degraded OST RAID Arrays {#degraded_ost}

Lustre includes functionality that notifies Lustre if an external RAID
array has degraded performance (resulting in reduced overall file system
performance), either because a disk has failed and not been replaced, or
because a disk was replaced and is undergoing a rebuild. To avoid a
global performance slowdown due to a degraded OST, the MDS can avoid the
OST for new object allocation if it is notified of the degraded state.

A parameter for each OST, called `degraded`, specifies whether the OST
is running in degraded mode or not.

To mark the OST as degraded, use:

    oss# lctl set_param obdfilter.{OST_name}.degraded=1

To mark that the OST is back in normal operation, use:

    oss# lctl set_param obdfilter.{OST_name}.degraded=0

To determine if OSTs are currently in degraded mode, use:

    oss# lctl get_param obdfilter.*.degraded

If the OST is remounted due to a reboot or other condition, the flag
resets to `0`.

It is recommended that this be implemented by an automated script that
monitors the status of individual RAID devices, such as MD-RAID\'s
`mdadm(8)` command with the `--monitor` option to mark an affected
device degraded or restored.

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="multiple file systems"}Running Multiple Lustre File Systems {#lustre_configure_multiple_fs}

Lustre supports multiple file systems provided the combination of
`NID:fsname` is unique. Each file system must be allocated a unique name
during creation with the `--fsname` parameter. Unique names for file
systems are enforced if a single MGS is present. If multiple MGSs are
present (for example if you have an MGS on every MDS) the administrator
is responsible for ensuring file system names are unique. A single MGS
and unique file system names provides a single point of administration
and allows commands to be issued against the file system even if it is
not mounted.

Lustre supports multiple file systems on a single MGS. With a single MGS
fsnames are guaranteed to be unique. Lustre also allows multiple MGSs to
co-exist. For example, multiple MGSs will be necessary if multiple file
systems on different Lustre software versions are to be concurrently
available. With multiple MGSs additional care must be taken to ensure
file system names are unique. Each file system should have a unique
fsname among all systems that may interoperate in the future.

By default, the `mkfs.lustre` command creates a file system named
`lustre`. To specify a different file system name (limited to 8
characters) at format time, use the `--fsname` option:

    oss# mkfs.lustre --fsname=file_system_name

::: note
The MDT, OSTs and clients in the new file system must use the same file
system name (prepended to the device name). For example, for a new file
system named `foo`, the MDT and two OSTs would be named `foo-MDT0000`,
`foo-OST0000`, and `foo-OST0001`.
:::

To mount a client on the file system, run:

    client# mount -t lustre mgsnode:/new_fsname /mount_point

For example, to mount a client on file system foo at mount point
/mnt/foo, run:

    client# mount -t lustre mgsnode:/foo /mnt/foo

::: note
If a client(s) will be mounted on several file systems, add the
following line to `/etc/xattr.conf` file to avoid problems when files
are moved between the file systems: `lustre.* skip`
:::

::: note
To ensure that a new MDT is added to an existing MGS create the MDT by
specifying: `--mdt --mgsnode=mgs_NID`.
:::

A Lustre installation with two file systems ( `foo` and `bar`) could
look like this, where the MGS node is `mgsnode@tcp0` and the mount
points are `/mnt/foo` and `/mnt/bar`.

    mgsnode# mkfs.lustre --mgs /dev/sda
    mdtfoonode# mkfs.lustre --fsname=foo --mgsnode=mgsnode@tcp0 --mdt --index=0
    /dev/sdb
    ossfoonode# mkfs.lustre --fsname=foo --mgsnode=mgsnode@tcp0 --ost --index=0
    /dev/sda
    ossfoonode# mkfs.lustre --fsname=foo --mgsnode=mgsnode@tcp0 --ost --index=1
    /dev/sdb
    mdtbarnode# mkfs.lustre --fsname=bar --mgsnode=mgsnode@tcp0 --mdt --index=0
    /dev/sda
    ossbarnode# mkfs.lustre --fsname=bar --mgsnode=mgsnode@tcp0 --ost --index=0
    /dev/sdc
    ossbarnode# mkfs.lustre --fsname=bar --mgsnode=mgsnode@tcp0 --ost --index=1
    /dev/sdd

To mount a client on file system foo at mount point `/mnt/foo`, run:

    client# mount -t lustre mgsnode@tcp0:/foo /mnt/foo

To mount a client on file system bar at mount point `/mnt/bar`, run:

    client# mount -t lustre mgsnode@tcp0:/bar /mnt/bar

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="remote directory"}Creating a sub-directory on a specific MDT {#lfsmkdir}

It is possible to create individual directories, along with its files
and sub-directories, to be stored on specific MDTs. To create a
sub-directory on a given MDT use the command:

    client$ lfs mkdir -i mdt_index /mount_point/remote_dir

This command will allocate the sub-directory `remote_dir` onto the MDT
with index `mdt_index`. For more information on adding additional MDTs
and `mdt_index` see [???](#addmdtindex).

::: warning
An administrator can allocate remote sub-directories to separate MDTs.
Creating remote sub-directories in parent directories not hosted on
MDT0000 is not recommended. This is because the failure of the parent
MDT will leave the namespace below it inaccessible. For this reason, by
default it is only possible to create remote sub-directories off
MDT0000. To relax this restriction and enable remote sub-directories off
any MDT, an administrator must issue the following command on the MGS:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P mdt.fsname-MDT*.enable_remote_dir=1

For Lustre filesystem \'scratch\', the command executed is:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P mdt.scratch-*.enable_remote_dir=1

To verify the configuration setting execute the following command on any
MDS:

    mds# lctl get_param mdt.*.enable_remote_dir
:::

With Lustre software version 2.8, a new tunable is available to allow
users with a specific group ID to create and delete remote and striped
directories. This tunable is `enable_remote_dir_gid`. For example,
setting this parameter to the \'wheel\' or \'admin\' group ID allows
users with that GID to create and delete remote and striped directories.
Setting this parameter to `-1` on MDT0000 to permanently allow any
non-root users create and delete remote and striped directories. On the
MGS execute the following command:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P mdt.fsname-*.enable_remote_dir_gid=-1

For the Lustre filesystem \'scratch\', the commands expands to:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P mdt.scratch-*.enable_remote_dir_gid=-1

The change can be verified by executing the following command on every
MDS:

    mds# lctl get_param mdt.*.enable_remote_dir_gid

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="striped directory"} []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="mkdir"} []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="setdirstripe"} []{.indexterm primary="striping" secondary="metadata"}Creating a directory striped across multiple MDTs {#lfsmkdirdne2}

The Lustre 2.8 DNE feature enables files in a single large directory to
be distributed across multiple MDTs (a *striped directory*), if there
are mutliple MDTs added to the filesystem, see
[???](#lustremaint.adding_new_mdt). The result is that metadata requests
for files in a single large striped directory are serviced by multiple
MDTs and metadata service load is distributed over all the MDTs that
service a given directory. By distributing metadata service load over
multiple MDTs, performance of very large directories can be improved
beyond the limit of one MDT. Normally, all files in a directory must be
created on a single MDT.

This command to stripe a directory over \<mdt_count\> MDTs is:

    client$ lfs mkdir -c mdt_count /mount_point/new_directory

The striped directory feature is most useful for distributing a single
large directory (50k entries or more) across multiple MDTs. This should
be used with discretion since creating and removing striped directories
incurs more overhead than non-striped directories.

### Directory creation by space/inode usage {#lfsmkdirbyspace}

If the starting MDT is not specified when creating a new directory, this
directory and its stripes will be distributed on MDTs by space usage.
For example the following will create a new directory on an MDT
preferring one that has less space usage:

    client$ lfs mkdir -c 1 -i -1 dir1

Alternatively, if a default directory stripe is set on a directory, the
subsequent use of `mkdir` for subdirectories in \<dir1\> will have the
same effect:

    client$ lfs setdirstripe -D -c 1 -i -1 dir1

The policy is:

-   If free inodes/blocks on all MDT are almost the same, i.e.
    `max_inodes_avail * 84% < min_inodes_avail` and
    `max_blocks_avail * 84% < min_blocks_avail`, then choose MDT
    roundrobin.

-   Otherwise, create more subdirectories on MDTs with more free
    inodes/blocks.

Sometime there are many MDTs. But it is not always desirable to stripe a
directory across all MDTs, even if the directory default
`stripe_count=-1` (unlimited). In this case, the per-filesystem tunable
parameter `lod.*.max_mdt_stripecount` can be used to limit the actual
stripe count of directory to fewer than the full MDT count. If
`lod.*.max_mdt_stripecount` is not 0, and the directory
`stripe_count=-1`, the real directory stripe count will be the minimum
of the number of MDTs and `max_mdt_stripecount`. If
`lod.*.max_mdt_stripecount=0`, or an explicit stripe count is given for
the directory, it is ignored.

To set `max_mdt_stripecount`, on all MDSes of file system, run:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P lod.$fsname-MDTxxxx-mdtlov.max_mdt_stripecount=<N>

To check `max_mdt_stripecount`, run:

    mds# lctl get_param lod.$fsname-MDTxxxx-mdtlov.max_mdt_stripecount

To reset `max_mdt_stripecount`, run:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P -d lod.$fsname-MDTxxxx-mdtlov.max_mdt_stripecount

### Filesystem-wide default directory striping {#fsdefaultlmv}

Similar to file objects allocation, the directory objects are allocated
on MDTs by a round-robin algorithm or a weighted algorithm. For the top
three level of directories from the root of the filesystem, if the
amount of free inodes and blocks is well balanced (i.e., by default,
when the free inodes and blocks across MDTs differ by less than 5%), the
round-robin algorithm is used to select the next MDT on which a
directory is to be created.

If the directory is more than three levels below the root directory, or
MDTs are not balanced, then the weighted algorithm is used to randomly
select an MDT with more free inodes and blocks.

To avoid creating unnecessary remote directories, if the MDT where its
parent directory is located is not too full (the free inodes and blocks
of the parent MDT is not more than 5% full than average of all MDTs),
this directory will be created on parent MDT.

If administrator wants to change this default filesystem-wide directory
striping, run the following command to limit this striping to the top
level below the root directory:

    client$ lfs setdirstripe -D -i -1 -c 1 --max-inherit 0 <mountpoint>

To revert to the pre-2.15 behavior of all directories being created only
on MDT0000 by default (deleting this striping won\'t work because it
will be recreated if missing):

    client$ lfs setdirstripe -D -i 0 -c 1 --max-inherit 0 <mountpoint>

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="default dir stripe policy"}Default Dir Stripe Policy {#default_dir_stripe_policy}

If default dir stripe policy is set to a directory, it will be applied
to sub directories created later. For example:

    $ mkdir testdir1
    $ lfs setdirstripe testdir1 -D -c 2
    $ lfs getdirstripe testdir1 -D
    lmv_stripe_count: 2 lmv_stripe_offset: -1 lmv_hash_type: none lmv_max_inherit: 3 lmv_max_inherit_rr: 0
    $ mkdir dir1/subdir1
    $ lfs getdirstripe testdir1/subdir1
    lmv_stripe_count: 2 lmv_stripe_offset: 0 lmv_hash_type: crush
    mdtidx       FID[seq:oid:ver]
         0       [0x200000400:0x2:0x0]
         1       [0x240000401:0x2:0x0]

Default dir stripe can be inherited by sub directory. This behavior is
controlled by `lmv_max_inherit` parameter. If `lmv_max_inherit` is 0 or
1, sub directory stops to inherit default dir stripe policy. Or sub
directory decreases its parent\'s `lmv_max_inherit` and uses it as its
own `lmv_max_inherit`. -1 is special because it means unlimited. For
example:

    $ lfs getdirstripe testdir1/subdir1 -D
    lmv_stripe_count: 2 lmv_stripe_offset: -1 lmv_hash_type: none lmv_max_inherit: 2 lmv_max_inherit_rr: 0

`lmv_max_inherit` can be set explicitly with `--max-inherit` option in
`lfs setdirstripe -D` command. If the max-inherit value is not
specified, the default value is -1 when `stripe_count` is 0 or 1. For
other values of `stripe_count`, the default value is 3.

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="parameters"}Setting and Retrieving Lustre Parameters {#set_get_lustre_params}

Several options are available for setting parameters in Lustre:

-   When creating a file system, use mkfs.lustre. See [Setting Tunable
    Parameters with ](#tuning_params_mkfs_lustre)below.

-   When a server is stopped, use tunefs.lustre. See [Setting Parameters
    with ](#setting_param_tunefs)below.

-   When the file system is running, use lctl to set or retrieve Lustre
    parameters. See [Setting Parameters with
    ](#setting_param_with_lctl)and [Reporting Current Parameter
    Values](#reporting_current_param)below.

### Setting Tunable Parameters with `mkfs.lustre` {#tuning_params_mkfs_lustre}

When the file system is first formatted, parameters can simply be added
as a `--param` option to the `mkfs.lustre` command. For example:

    mds# mkfs.lustre --mdt --param="sys.timeout=50" /dev/sda

For more details about creating a file system,see
[???](#configuringlustre). For more details about `mkfs.lustre`, see
[???](#systemconfigurationutilities).

### Setting Parameters with `tunefs.lustre` {#setting_param_tunefs}

If a server (OSS or MDS) is stopped, parameters can be added to an
existing file system using the `--param` option to the `tunefs.lustre`
command. For example:

    oss# tunefs.lustre --param=failover.node=192.168.0.13@tcp0 /dev/sda

With `tunefs.lustre`, parameters are *additive*\-- new parameters are
specified in addition to old parameters, they do not replace them. To
erase all old `tunefs.lustre` parameters and just use newly-specified
parameters, run:

    mds# tunefs.lustre --erase-params --param=new_parameters

The tunefs.lustre command can be used to set any parameter settable via
`lctl conf_param` and that has its own OBD device, so it can be
specified as `obdname|fsname. obdtype. proc_file_name= value`. For
example:

    mds# tunefs.lustre --param mdt.identity_upcall=NONE /dev/sda1

For more details about `tunefs.lustre`, see
[???](#systemconfigurationutilities).

### Setting Parameters with `lctl` {#setting_param_with_lctl}

When the file system is running, the `lctl` command can be used to set
parameters (temporary or permanent) and report current parameter values.
Temporary parameters are active as long as the server or client is not
shut down. Permanent parameters live through server and client reboots.

::: note
The `lctl list_param` command enables users to list all parameters that
can be set. See [Listing All Tunable Parameters](#list_params).
:::

For more details about the `lctl` command, see the examples in the
sections below and [???](#systemconfigurationutilities).

#### Setting Temporary Parameters

Use `lctl set_param` to set temporary parameters on the node where it is
run. These parameters internally map to corresponding items in the
kernel `/proc/{fs,sys}/{lnet,lustre}` and
`/sys/{fs,kernel/debug}/lustre` virtual filesystems. However, since the
mapping between a particular parameter name and the underlying virtual
pathname may change, it is *not* recommended to access the virtual
pathname directly. The `lctl set_param` command uses this syntax:

    # lctl set_param [-n] [-P] obdtype.obdname.proc_file_name=value

For example:

    # lctl set_param osc.*.max_dirty_mb=1024
    osc.myth-OST0000-osc.max_dirty_mb=32
    osc.myth-OST0001-osc.max_dirty_mb=32
    osc.myth-OST0002-osc.max_dirty_mb=32
    osc.myth-OST0003-osc.max_dirty_mb=32
    osc.myth-OST0004-osc.max_dirty_mb=32

#### Setting Permanent Parameters {#setting_permanent_params}

Use `lctl set_param -P` or `lctl conf_param` command to set permanent
parameters. In general, the `set_param -P` command is preferred for new
parameters, as this isolates the parameter settings from the MDT and OST
device configuration, and is consistent with the common `lctl get_param`
and `lctl set_param` commands. The `lctl conf_param` command was
previously used to specify settable parameter, with the following syntax
(the same as the `mkfs.lustre` and `tunefs.lustre` commands):

    obdname|fsname.obdtype.proc_file_name=value)

::: note
The `lctl conf_param` and `lctl set_param` syntax is *not* the same.
:::

Here are a few examples of `lctl conf_param` commands:

    mgs# lctl conf_param testfs-MDT0000.sys.timeout=40
    mgs# lctl conf_param testfs-MDT0000.mdt.identity_upcall=NONE
    mgs# lctl conf_param testfs.llite.max_read_ahead_mb=16
    mgs# lctl conf_param testfs-OST0000.osc.max_dirty_mb=29.15
    mgs# lctl conf_param testfs-OST0000.ost.client_cache_seconds=15
    mgs# lctl conf_param testfs.sys.timeout=40

::: caution
Parameters specified with the `lctl conf_param` command are set
permanently in the file system\'s configuration file on the MGS.
:::

#### Setting Permanent Parameters with lctl set_param -P {#setparamp}

The `lctl set_param -P` command can also set parameters permanently
using the same syntax as `lctl set_param` and `lctl get_param` commands.
Permanent parameter settings must be issued on the MGS. The given
parameter is set on every host using `lctl` upcall. The `lctl set_param`
command uses the following syntax:

    lctl set_param -P obdtype.obdname.proc_file_name=value

For example:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P timeout=40
    mgs# lctl set_param -P mdt.testfs-MDT*.identity_upcall=NONE
    mgs# lctl set_param -P llite.testfs-*.max_read_ahead_mb=16
    mgs# lctl set_param -P osc.testfs-OST*.max_dirty_mb=29.15
    mgs# lctl set_param -P ost.testfs-OST*.client_cache_seconds=15

Use the `-P -d` option to delete permanent parameters. Syntax:

    lctl set_param -P -d obdtype.obdname.parameter_name

For example:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P -d osc.*.max_dirty_mb

::: note
Starting in Lustre 2.12, there is `lctl get_param` command can provide
*tab completion* when using an interactive shell with `bash-completion`
installed. This simplifies the use of `get_param` significantly, since
it provides an interactive list of available parameters.
:::

#### Listing Persistent Parameters {#persistent_params}

To list tunable parameters stored in the `params` log file by
`lctl set_param -P` and applied to nodes at mount, run the
`lctl --device MGS llog_print params` command on the MGS. For example:

    mgs# lctl --device MGS llog_print params
    - { index: 2, event: set_param, device: general, parameter: osc.*.max_dirty_mb, value: 1024 }

#### Listing All Tunable Parameters {#list_params}

To list Lustre or LNet parameters that are available to set, use the
`lctl list_param` command. For example:

    lctl list_param [-FR] obdtype.obdname

The following arguments are available for the `lctl list_param` command.

`-F` Add \' `/`\', \' `@`\' or \' `=`\' for directories, symlinks and
writeable files, respectively

`-R` Recursively lists all parameters under the specified path

For example:

    oss# lctl list_param obdfilter.lustre-OST0000

#### Reporting Current Parameter Values {#reporting_current_param}

To report current Lustre parameter values, use the `lctl get_param`
command with this syntax:

    lctl get_param [-n] obdtype.obdname.proc_file_name

::: note
Starting in Lustre 2.12, there is `lctl get_param` command can provide
*tab completion* when using an interactive shell with `bash-completion`
installed. This simplifies the use of `get_param` significantly, since
it provides an interactive list of available parameters.
:::

This example reports data on RPC service times.

    oss# lctl get_param -n ost.*.ost_io.timeouts
    service : cur 1 worst 30 (at 1257150393, 85d23h58m54s ago) 1 1 1 1

This example reports the amount of space this client has reserved for
writeback cache with each OST:

    client# lctl get_param osc.*.cur_grant_bytes
    osc.myth-OST0000-osc-ffff8800376bdc00.cur_grant_bytes=2097152
    osc.myth-OST0001-osc-ffff8800376bdc00.cur_grant_bytes=33890304
    osc.myth-OST0002-osc-ffff8800376bdc00.cur_grant_bytes=35418112
    osc.myth-OST0003-osc-ffff8800376bdc00.cur_grant_bytes=2097152
    osc.myth-OST0004-osc-ffff8800376bdc00.cur_grant_bytes=33808384

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="failover"}Specifying NIDs and Failover {#failover_nids}

If a node has multiple network interfaces, it may have multiple NIDs,
which must all be identified so other nodes can choose the NID that is
appropriate for their network interfaces. Typically, NIDs are specified
in a list delimited by commas ( `,`). However, when failover nodes are
specified, the NIDs are delimited by a colon ( `:`) or by repeating a
keyword such as `--mgsnode=` or `--servicenode=`).

To display the NIDs of all servers in networks configured to work with
the Lustre file system, run (while LNet is running):

    # lctl list_nids

In the example below, `mds0` and `mds1` are configured as a combined
MGS/MDT failover pair and `oss0` and `oss1` are configured as an OST
failover pair. The Ethernet address for `mds0` is 192.168.10.1, and for
`mds1` is 192.168.10.2. The Ethernet addresses for `oss0` and `oss1` are
192.168.10.20 and 192.168.10.21 respectively.

    mds0# mkfs.lustre --fsname=testfs --mdt --mgs \
            --servicenode=192.168.10.2@tcp0 \
            --servicenode=192.168.10.1@tcp0 /dev/sda1
    mds0# mount -t lustre /dev/sda1 /mnt/test/mdt
    oss0# mkfs.lustre --fsname=testfs --servicenode=192.168.10.20@tcp0 \
            --servicenode=192.168.10.21 --ost --index=0 \
            --mgsnode=192.168.10.1@tcp0 --mgsnode=192.168.10.2@tcp0 \
            /dev/sdb
    oss0# mount -t lustre /dev/sdb /mnt/test/ost0
    client# mount -t lustre 192.168.10.1@tcp0:192.168.10.2@tcp0:/testfs \
            /mnt/testfs
    mds0# umount /mnt/mdt
    mds1# mount -t lustre /dev/sda1 /mnt/test/mdt
    mds1# lctl get_param mdt.testfs-MDT0000.recovery_status

Where multiple NIDs are specified separated by commas (for example,
`10.67.73.200@tcp,192.168.10.1@tcp`), the two NIDs refer to the same
host, and the Lustre software chooses the *best* one for communication.
When a pair of NIDs is separated by a colon (for example,
`10.67.73.200@tcp:10.67.73.201@tcp`), the two NIDs refer to two
different hosts and are treated as a failover pair (the Lustre software
tries the first one, and if that fails, it tries the second one.)

Two options to `mkfs.lustre` can be used to specify failover nodes. The
`--servicenode` option is used to specify all service NIDs, including
those for primary nodes and failover nodes. When the `--servicenode`
option is used, the first service node to load the target device becomes
the primary service node, while nodes corresponding to the other
specified NIDs become failover locations for the target device. An older
option, `--failnode`, specifies just the NIDs of failover nodes. For
more information about the `--servicenode` and `--failnode` options, see
[???](#configuringfailover).

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="erasing a file system"}Erasing a File System {#erasing_filesystem}

If you want to erase a file system and permanently delete all the data
in the file system, run this command on your targets:

    # mkfs.lustre --reformat

If you are using a separate MGS and want to keep other file systems
defined on that MGS, then set the `writeconf` flag on the MDT for that
file system. The `writeconf` flag causes the configuration logs to be
erased; they are regenerated the next time the servers start.

To set the `writeconf` flag on the MDT:

1.  Unmount all clients/servers using this file system, run:

        client# umount /mnt/lustre

2.  Permanently erase the file system and, presumably, replace it with
    another file system, run:

        mgs# mkfs.lustre --reformat --fsname spfs --mgs --mdt --index=0 /dev/mdsdev

3.  If you have a separate MGS (that you do not want to reformat), then
    add the `--writeconf` flag to `mkfs.lustre` on the MDT, run:

        mgs# mkfs.lustre --reformat --writeconf --fsname spfs --mgsnode=mgs_nid \
               --mdt --index=0 /dev/mds_device

::: note
If you have a combined MGS/MDT, reformatting the MDT reformats the MGS
as well, causing all configuration information to be lost; you can start
building your new file system. Nothing needs to be done with old disks
that will not be part of the new file system, just do not mount them.
:::

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="reclaiming space"}Reclaiming Reserved Disk Space {#reclaiming_reserved_disk_space}

All current Lustre installations run the ldiskfs file system internally
on service nodes. By default, ldiskfs reserves 5% of the disk space to
avoid file system fragmentation. In order to reclaim this space, run the
following command on your OSS for each OST in the file system:

    # tune2fs [-m reserved_blocks_percent] /dev/ostdev

You do not need to shut down Lustre before running this command or
restart it afterwards.

::: warning
Reducing the space reservation can cause severe performance degradation
as the OST file system becomes more than 95% full, due to difficulty in
locating large areas of contiguous free space. This performance
degradation may persist even if the space usage drops below 95% again.
It is recommended NOT to reduce the reserved disk space below 5%.
:::

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="replacing an OST or MDS"}Replacing an Existing OST or MDT {#replacing_existing_ost_mdt}

To copy the contents of an existing OST to a new OST (or an old MDT to a
new MDT), follow the process for either OST/MDT backups in
[???](#backup_device)or [???](#backup_fs_level). For more information on
removing a MDT, see [???](#lustremaint.rmremotedir).

## []{.indexterm primary="operations" secondary="identifying OSTs"}Identifying To Which Lustre File an OST Object Belongs {#identifying_file_objects}

Use this procedure to identify the file containing a given object on a
given OST.

1.  On the OST (as root), run `debugfs` to display the file identifier (
    `FID`) of the file associated with the object.

    For example, if the object is `34976` on `/dev/lustre/ost_test2`,
    the debug command is:

        # debugfs -c -R "stat /O/0/d$((34976 % 32))/34976" /dev/lustre/ost_test2

    The command output is:

        debugfs 1.45.6.wc1 (20-Mar-2020)
        /dev/lustre/ost_test2: catastrophic mode - not reading inode or group bitmaps
        Inode: 352365   Type: regular    Mode:  0666   Flags: 0x80000

        00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 " (32)
          fid: objid=34976 seq=0 parent=[0x200000400:0x122:0x0] stripe=1
        EXTENTS:
        (0-64):4620544-4620607

2.  The parent FID will be of the form `[0x200000400:0x122:0x0]` and can
    be resolved directly using the command
    `lfs fid2path [0x200000404:0x122:0x0] /mnt/lustre` on any Lustre
    client, and the process is complete.

3.  In cases of an upgraded 1.x inode (if the first part of the FID is
    below 0x200000400), the MDT inode number is `0x24dab9` and
    generation `0x3f0dfa6a` and the pathname can also be resolved using
    `debugfs`.

4.  On the MDS (as root), use `debugfs` to find the file associated with
    the inode:

        # debugfs -c -R "ncheck 0x24dab9" /dev/lustre/mdt_test
        debugfs 1.42.3.wc3 (15-Aug-2012)
        /dev/lustre/mdt_test: catastrophic mode - not reading inode or group bitmaps
        Inode      Pathname
        2415289    /ROOT/brian-laptop-guest/clients/client11/~dmtmp/PWRPNT/ZD16.BMP

The command lists the inode and pathname associated with the object.

::: note
`Debugfs`\' \'\'ncheck\'\' is a brute-force search that may take a long
time to complete.
