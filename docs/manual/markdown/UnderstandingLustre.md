## []{.indexterm primary="Lustre"}What a Lustre File System Is (and What It Isn\'t) {#understandinglustre.whatislustre}

The Lustre architecture is a storage architecture for clusters. The
central component of the Lustre architecture is the Lustre file system,
which is supported on the Linux operating system and provides a POSIX
^\*^standard-compliant UNIX file system interface.

The Lustre storage architecture is used for many different kinds of
clusters. It is best known for powering many of the largest
high-performance computing (HPC) clusters worldwide, with tens of
thousands of client systems, petabytes (PiB) of storage and hundreds of
gigabytes per second (GB/sec) of I/O throughput. Many HPC sites use a
Lustre file system as a site-wide global file system, serving dozens of
clusters.

The ability of a Lustre file system to scale capacity and performance
for any need reduces the need to deploy many separate file systems, such
as one for each compute cluster. Storage management is simplified by
avoiding the need to copy data between compute clusters. In addition to
aggregating storage capacity of many servers, the I/O throughput is also
aggregated and scales with additional servers. Moreover, throughput
and/or capacity can be easily increased by adding servers dynamically.

While a Lustre file system can function in many work environments, it is
not necessarily the best choice for all applications. It is best suited
for uses that exceed the capacity that a single server can provide,
though in some use cases, a Lustre file system can perform better with a
single server than other file systems due to its strong locking and data
coherency.

A Lustre file system is currently not particularly well suited for
\"peer-to-peer\" usage models where clients and servers are running on
the same node, each sharing a small amount of storage, due to the lack
of data replication at the Lustre software level. In such uses, if one
client/server fails, then the data stored on that node will not be
accessible until the node is restarted.

### []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="features"}Lustre Features

Lustre file systems run on a variety of vendor\'s kernels. For more
details, see the Lustre Test Matrix [???](#preparing_installation).

A Lustre installation can be scaled up or down with respect to the
number of client nodes, storage capacity and bandwidth. Scalability and
performance are dependent on available storage and network bandwidth and
the processing power of the servers in the system. A Lustre filesystem
can be deployed in a wide variety of configurations that can be scaled
well beyond the size and performance observed in production systems to
date.

[Lustre File System Scalability and
Performance](#understandinglustre.tab1) shows some of the scalability
and performance characteristics of a Lustre file system. For a full list
of Lustre file and filesystem limits see

: Lustre File System Scalability and Performance

Other Lustre software features are:

-   **Performance-enhanced ext4 file system:**The Lustre file system
    uses an improved version of the ext4 journaling file system to store
    data and metadata. This version, called *`ldiskfs`* , has been
    enhanced to improve performance and provide additional functionality
    needed by the Lustre file system.

-   It is also possible to use ZFS as the backing filesystem for Lustre
    for the MDT, OST, and MGS storage. This allows Lustre to leverage
    the scalability and data integrity features of ZFS for individual
    storage targets.

-   **POSIX standard compliance:**The full POSIX test suite passes in an
    identical manner to a local ext4 file system, with limited
    exceptions on Lustre clients. In a cluster, most operations are
    atomic so that clients never see stale data or metadata. The Lustre
    software supports mmap() file I/O.

-   **High-performance heterogeneous networking:**The Lustre software
    supports a variety of high performance, low latency networks and
    permits Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) for InfiniBand
    ^\*^(utilizing OpenFabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED^\*^), Intel
    OmniPath®, and other advanced networks for fast and efficient
    network transport. Multiple RDMA networks can be bridged using
    Lustre routing for maximum performance. The Lustre software also
    includes integrated network diagnostics.

-   **High-availability:**The Lustre file system supports active/active
    failover using shared storage partitions for OSS targets (OSTs), and
    for MDS targets (MDTs). The Lustre file system can work with a
    variety of high availability (HA) managers to allow automated
    failover and has no single point of failure (NSPF). This allows
    application transparent recovery. Multiple mount protection (MMP)
    provides integrated protection from errors in highly-available
    systems that would otherwise cause file system corruption.

-   **Security:**By default TCP connections are only allowed from
    privileged ports. UNIX group membership is verified on the MDS.

-   **Access control list (ACL), extended attributes:**the Lustre
    security model follows that of a UNIX file system, enhanced with
    POSIX ACLs. Noteworthy additional features include root squash.

-   **Interoperability:**The Lustre file system runs on a variety of CPU
    architectures and mixed-endian clusters and is interoperable between
    successive major Lustre software releases.

-   **Object-based architecture:**Clients are isolated from the on-disk
    file structure enabling upgrading of the storage architecture
    without affecting the client.

-   **Byte-granular file and fine-grained metadata locking:**Many
    clients can read and modify the same file or directory concurrently.
    The Lustre distributed lock manager (LDLM) ensures that files are
    coherent between all clients and servers in the file system. The MDT
    LDLM manages locks on inode permissions and pathnames. Each OST has
    its own LDLM for locks on file stripes stored thereon, which scales
    the locking performance as the file system grows.

-   **Quotas:**User and group quotas are available for a Lustre file
    system.

-   **Capacity growth:**The size of a Lustre file system and aggregate
    cluster bandwidth can be increased without interruption by adding
    new OSTs and MDTs to the cluster.

-   **Controlled file layout:**The layout of files across OSTs can be
    configured on a per file, per directory, or per file system basis.
    This allows file I/O to be tuned to specific application
    requirements within a single file system. The Lustre file system
    uses RAID-0 striping and balances space usage across OSTs.

-   **Network data integrity protection:**A checksum of all data sent
    from the client to the OSS protects against corruption during data
    transfer.

-   **MPI I/O:**The Lustre architecture has a dedicated MPI ADIO layer
    that optimizes parallel I/O to match the underlying file system
    architecture.

-   **NFS and CIFS export:**Lustre files can be re-exported using NFS
    (via Linux knfsd or Ganesha) or CIFS (via Samba), enabling them to
    be shared with non-Linux clients such as Microsoft^\*^Windows,
    ^\*^Apple ^\*^Mac OS X ^\*^, and others.

-   **Disaster recovery tool:**The Lustre file system provides an online
    distributed file system check (LFSCK) that can restore consistency
    between storage components in case of a major file system error. A
    Lustre file system can operate even in the presence of file system
    inconsistencies, and LFSCK can run while the filesystem is in use,
    so LFSCK is not required to complete before returning the file
    system to production.

-   **Performance monitoring:**The Lustre file system offers a variety
    of mechanisms to examine performance and tuning.

-   **Open source:**The Lustre software is licensed under the GPL 2.0
    license for use with the Linux operating system.

## []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="components"}Lustre Components {#understandinglustre.components}

An installation of the Lustre software includes a management server
(MGS) and one or more Lustre file systems interconnected with Lustre
networking (LNet).

A basic configuration of Lustre file system components is shown in
[Lustre file system components in a basic
cluster](#understandinglustre.fig.cluster).

![Lustre file system components in a basic
cluster](./figures/Basic_Cluster.png){#understandinglustre.fig.cluster
width="100%"}

### []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="MGS"}Management Server (MGS)

The MGS stores configuration information for all the Lustre file systems
in a cluster and provides this information to other Lustre components.
Each Lustre target contacts the MGS to provide information, and Lustre
clients contact the MGS to retrieve information.

It is preferable that the MGS have its own storage space so that it can
be managed independently. However, the MGS can be co-located and share
storage space with an MDS as shown in [Lustre file system components in
a basic cluster](#understandinglustre.fig.cluster).

### Lustre File System Components

Each Lustre file system consists of the following components:

-   **Metadata Servers (MDS)**- The MDS makes metadata stored in one or
    more MDTs available to Lustre clients. Each MDS manages the names
    and directories in the Lustre file system(s) and provides network
    request handling for one or more local MDTs.

-   **Metadata Targets (MDT**) - Each filesystem has at least one MDT,
    which holds the root directory. The MDT stores metadata (such as
    filenames, directories, permissions and file layout) on storage
    attached to an MDS. Each file system has one MDT. An MDT on a shared
    storage target can be available to multiple MDSs, although only one
    can access it at a time. If an active MDS fails, a second MDS node
    can serve the MDT and make it available to clients. This is referred
    to as MDS failover.

    Multiple MDTs are supported with the Distributed Namespace
    Environment ([???](#DNE)). In addition to the primary MDT that holds
    the filesystem root, it is possible to add additional MDS nodes,
    each with their own MDTs, to hold sub-directory trees of the
    filesystem.

    Since Lustre software release 2.8, DNE also allows the filesystem to
    distribute files of a single directory over multiple MDT nodes. A
    directory which is distributed across multiple MDTs is known as a
    *[???](#stripeddirectory)*.

-   **Object Storage Servers (OSS)**: The OSS provides file I/O service
    and network request handling for one or more local OSTs. Typically,
    an OSS serves between two and eight OSTs, up to 16 TiB each. A
    typical configuration is an MDT on a dedicated node, two or more
    OSTs on each OSS node, and a client on each of a large number of
    compute nodes.

-   **Object Storage Target (OST)**: User file data is stored in one or
    more objects, each object on a separate OST in a Lustre file system.
    The number of objects per file is configurable by the user and can
    be tuned to optimize performance for a given workload.

-   **Lustre clients**: Lustre clients are computational, visualization
    or desktop nodes that are running Lustre client software, allowing
    them to mount the Lustre file system.

The Lustre client software provides an interface between the Linux
virtual file system and the Lustre servers. The client software includes
a management client (MGC), a metadata client (MDC), and multiple object
storage clients (OSCs), one corresponding to each OST in the file
system.

A logical object volume (LOV) aggregates the OSCs to provide transparent
access across all the OSTs. Thus, a client with the Lustre file system
mounted sees a single, coherent, synchronized namespace. Several clients
can write to different parts of the same file simultaneously, while, at
the same time, other clients can read from the file.

A logical metadata volume (LMV) aggregates the MDCs to provide
transparent access across all the MDTs in a similar manner as the LOV
does for file access. This allows the client to see the directory tree
on multiple MDTs as a single coherent namespace, and striped directories
are merged on the clients to form a single visible directory to users
and applications.

Lustre Networking (LNet) is a custom networking API that provides the
communication infrastructure that handles metadata and file I/O data for
the Lustre file system servers and clients. For more information about
LNet, see [???](#understandinglustrenetworking).

### []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="cluster"}Lustre Cluster

At scale, a Lustre file system cluster can include hundreds of OSSs and
thousands of clients (see [ Lustre cluster at
scale](#understandinglustre.fig.lustrescale)). More than one type of
network can be used in a Lustre cluster. Shared storage between OSSs
enables failover capability. For more details about OSS failover, see
[???](#understandingfailover).

## []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="storage"} []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="I/O"}Lustre File System Storage and I/O {#understandinglustre.storageio}

Lustre File IDentifiers (FIDs) are used internally for identifying files
or objects, similar to inode numbers in local filesystems. A FID is a
128-bit identifier, which contains a unique 64-bit sequence number
(SEQ), a 32-bit object ID (OID), and a 32-bit version number. The
sequence number is unique across all Lustre targets in a file system
(OSTs and MDTs). This allows multiple MDTs and OSTs to uniquely identify
objects without depending on identifiers in the underlying filesystem
(e.g. inode numbers) that are likely to be duplicated between targets.
The FID SEQ number also allows mapping a FID to a particular MDT or OST.

The LFSCK file system consistency checking tool provides functionality
that enables FID-in-dirent for existing files. It includes the following
functionality:

-   Verifies the FID stored with each directory entry and regenerates it
    from the inode if it is invalid or missing.

-   Verifies the linkEA entry for each inode and regenerates it if
    invalid or missing. The *linkEA* stores the file name and parent
    FID. It is stored as an extended attribute in each inode. Thus, the
    linkEA can be used to reconstruct the full path name of a file from
    only the FID.

Information about where file data is located on the OST(s) is stored as
an extended attribute called layout EA in an MDT object identified by
the FID for the file (see [Layout EA on MDT pointing to file data on
OSTs](#Fig1.3_LayoutEAonMDT)). If the file is a regular file (not a
directory or symbol link), the MDT object points to 1-to-N OST object(s)
on the OST(s) that contain the file data. If the MDT file points to one
object, all the file data is stored in that object. If the MDT file
points to more than one object, the file data is *striped* across the
objects using RAID 0, and each object is stored on a different OST. (For
more information about how striping is implemented in a Lustre file
system, see [ Lustre File System and Striping](#lustre_striping).

![Layout EA on MDT pointing to file data on
OSTs](./figures/Metadata_File.png){#Fig1.3_LayoutEAonMDT width="80%"}

When a client wants to read from or write to a file, it first fetches
the layout EA from the MDT object for the file. The client then uses
this information to perform I/O on the file, directly interacting with
the OSS nodes where the objects are stored. This process is illustrated
in [Lustre client requesting file data](#Fig1.4_ClientReqstgData) .

data](./figures/File_Write.png){#Fig1.4_ClientReqstgData width="75%"}

The available bandwidth of a Lustre file system is determined as
follows:

-   The *network bandwidth* equals the aggregated bandwidth of the OSSs
    to the targets.

-   The *disk bandwidth* equals the sum of the disk bandwidths of the
    storage targets (OSTs) up to the limit of the network bandwidth.

-   The *aggregate bandwidth* equals the minimum of the disk bandwidth
    and the network bandwidth.

-   The *available file system space* equals the sum of the available
    space of all the OSTs.

### []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="striping"} []{.indexterm primary="striping" secondary="overview"}Lustre File System and Striping {#lustre_striping}

One of the main factors leading to the high performance of Lustre file
systems is the ability to stripe data across multiple OSTs in a
round-robin fashion. Users can optionally configure for each file the
number of stripes, stripe size, and OSTs that are used.

Striping can be used to improve performance when the aggregate bandwidth
to a single file exceeds the bandwidth of a single OST. The ability to
stripe is also useful when a single OST does not have enough free space
to hold an entire file. For more information about benefits and
drawbacks of file striping, see [???](#file_striping.considerations).

Striping allows segments or \'chunks\' of data in a file to be stored on
different OSTs, as shown in [File striping on a Lustre file
system](#understandinglustre.fig.filestripe). In the Lustre file system,
a RAID 0 pattern is used in which data is \"striped\" across a certain
number of objects. The number of objects in a single file is called the
`stripe_count`.

Each object contains a chunk of data from the file. When the chunk of
data being written to a particular object exceeds the `stripe_size`, the
next chunk of data in the file is stored on the next object.

Default values for `stripe_count` and `stripe_size` are set for the file
system. The default value for `stripe_count` is 1 stripe for file and
the default value for `stripe_size` is 1MB. The user may change these
values on a per directory or per file basis. For more details, see
[???](#file_striping.lfs_setstripe).

[File striping on a Lustre file
system](#understandinglustre.fig.filestripe), the `stripe_size` for File
C is larger than the `stripe_size` for File A, allowing more data to be
stored in a single stripe for File C. The `stripe_count` for File A is
3, resulting in data striped across three objects, while the
`stripe_count` for File B and File C is 1.

No space is reserved on the OST for unwritten data. File A in [File
striping on a Lustre file system](#understandinglustre.fig.filestripe).

The maximum file size is not limited by the size of a single target. In
a Lustre file system, files can be striped across multiple objects (up
to 2000), and each object can be up to 16 TiB in size with ldiskfs, or
up to 256PiB with ZFS. This leads to a maximum file size of 31.25 PiB
for ldiskfs or 8EiB with ZFS. Note that a Lustre file system can support
files up to 2\^63 bytes (8EiB), limited only by the space available on
the OSTs.

::: note
ldiskfs filesystems without the `ea_inode` feature limit the maximum
stripe count for a single file to 160 OSTs.
:::

Although a single file can only be striped over 2000 objects, Lustre
file systems can have thousands of OSTs. The I/O bandwidth to access a
single file is the aggregated I/O bandwidth to the objects in a file,
which can be as much as a bandwidth of up to 2000 servers. On systems
with more than 2000 OSTs, clients can do I/O using multiple files to
utilize the full file system bandwidth.

[???](#managingstripingfreespace).

**Extended Attributes(xattrs)**

Lustre uses lov_user_md_v1/lov_user_md_v3 data-structures to maintain
its file striping information under xattrs. Extended attributes are
created when files and directory are created. Lustre uses `trusted`
extended attributes to store its parameters which are root-only
accessible. The parameters are:

-   **`trusted.lov`:** Holds layout for a regular file, or default file
    layout stored on a directory (also accessible as `lustre.lov` for
    non-root users).

-   **`trusted.lma`:** Holds FID and extra state flags for current file

-   **`trusted.lmv`:** Holds layout for a striped directory (DNE 2), not
    present otherwise

-   **`trusted.link`:** Holds parent directory FID + filename for each
    link to a file (for `lfs fid2path`)

xattr which are stored and present in the file could be verify using:

    # getfattr -d -m - /mnt/testfs/file>
