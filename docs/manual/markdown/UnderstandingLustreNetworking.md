## []{.indexterm primary="LNet"}[]{.indexterm primary="LNet" secondary="understanding"} Introducing LNet {#understanding_lnet}

In a cluster using one or more Lustre file systems, the network
communication infrastructure required by the Lustre file system is
implemented using the Lustre networking (LNet) feature.

LNet supports many commonly-used network types, such as InfiniBand and
IP networks, and allows simultaneous availability across multiple
network types with routing between them. Remote direct memory access
(RDMA) is permitted when supported by underlying networks using the
appropriate Lustre network driver (LND). High availability and recovery
features enable transparent recovery in conjunction with failover
servers.

An LND is a pluggable driver that provides support for a particular
network type, for example `ksocklnd` is the driver which implements the
TCP Socket LND that supports TCP networks. LNDs are loaded into the
driver stack, with one LND for each network type in use.

For information about configuring LNet, see [???](#configuringlnet).

## []{.indexterm primary="LNet" secondary="features"}Key Features of LNet {#lnet_key_feature}

Key features of LNet include:

-   RDMA, when supported by underlying networks

-   Support for many commonly-used network types

-   High availability and recovery

-   Support of multiple network types simultaneously

-   Routing among disparate networks

LNet permits end-to-end read/write throughput at or near peak bandwidth
rates on a variety of network interconnects.

## []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="Networks"}Lustre Networks {#idp694976}

A Lustre network is comprised of clients and servers running the Lustre
software. It need not be confined to one LNet subnet but can span
several networks provided routing is possible between the networks. In a
similar manner, a single network can have multiple LNet subnets.

The Lustre networking stack is comprised of two layers, the LNet code
module and the LND. The LNet layer operates above the LND layer in a
manner similar to the way the network layer operates above the data link
layer. LNet layer is connectionless, asynchronous and does not verify
that data has been transmitted while the LND layer is connection
oriented and typically does verify data transmission.

LNets are uniquely identified by a label comprised of a string
corresponding to an LND and a number, such as tcp0, o2ib0, or o2ib1,
that uniquely identifies each LNet. Each node on an LNet has at least
one network identifier (NID). A NID is a combination of the address of
the network interface and the LNet label in the
form:`address@LNet_label`.

Examples:

    192.168.1.2@tcp0
    10.13.24.90@o2ib1

In certain circumstances it might be desirable for Lustre file system
traffic to pass between multiple LNets. This is possible using LNet
routing. It is important to realize that LNet routing is not the same as
network routing. For more details about LNet routing, see
[???](#configuringlnet)

## []{.indexterm primary="LNet" secondary="supported networks"}Supported Network Types {#supported_networks}

The LNet code module includes LNDs to support many network types
including:

-   InfiniBand: OpenFabrics OFED (o2ib)

-   TCP (any network carrying TCP traffic, including GigE, 10GigE, and
    IPoIB)

-   RapidArray: ra

-   Quadrics: Elan
