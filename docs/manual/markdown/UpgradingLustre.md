# Upgrading a Lustre File System {#upgradinglustre}

This chapter describes interoperability between Lustre software
releases. It also provides procedures for upgrading from older Lustre
2.x software releases to a more recent 2.y Lustre release a (major
release upgrade), and from a Lustre software release 2.x.y to a more
recent Lustre software release 2.x.z (minor release upgrade). It
includes the following sections:

-   [ Release Interoperability and Upgrade
    Requirements](#interop_upgrade_requirement)

-   [ Upgrading to Lustre Software Release 2.x (Major
    Release)](#Upgrading_2.x)

-   [ Upgrading to Lustre Software Release 2.x.y (Minor
    Release)](#Upgrading_2.x.x)

## []{.indexterm primary="Lustre" secondary="upgrading" see="upgrading"} []{.indexterm primary="upgrading"}Release Interoperability and Upgrade Requirements {#interop_upgrade_requirement}

***Lustre software release 2.x (major) upgrade:***

-   All servers must be upgraded at the same time, while some or all
    clients may be upgraded independently of the servers.

-   All servers must be be upgraded to a Linux kernel supported by the
    Lustre software. See the Lustre Release Notes for your Lustre
    version for a list of tested Linux distributions.

-   Clients to be upgraded must be running a compatible Linux
    distribution as described in the Release Notes.

***Lustre software release 2.x.y release (minor) upgrade:***

-   All servers must be upgraded at the same time, while some or all
    clients may be upgraded.

-   Rolling upgrades are supported for minor releases allowing
    individual servers and clients to be upgraded without stopping the
    Lustre file system.

The procedure for upgrading from a Lustre software release 2.x to a more
recent 2.y major release of the Lustre software is described in this
section. To upgrade an existing 2.x installation to a more recent major
release, complete the following steps:

1.  Create a complete, restorable file system backup.

    ::: caution
    Before installing the Lustre software, back up ALL data. The Lustre
    software contains kernel modifications that interact with storage
    devices and may introduce security issues and data loss if not
    installed, configured, or administered properly. If a full backup of
    the file system is not practical, a device-level backup of the MDT
    file system is recommended. See [???](#backupandrestore) for a
    procedure.
    :::

2.  Shut down the entire filesystem by following [???](#shutdownLustre)

3.  Upgrade the Linux operating system on all servers to a compatible
    (tested) Linux distribution and reboot.

4.  Upgrade the Linux operating system on all clients to a compatible
    (tested) distribution and reboot.

5.  Download the Lustre server RPMs for your platform from the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository. See [???](#table.installed_server_pkg)for a list of
    required packages.

6.  Install the Lustre server packages on all Lustre servers (MGS, MDSs,
    and OSSs).

    a.  Log onto a Lustre server as the `root` user

    b.  Use the `yum` command to install the packages:

            # yum --nogpgcheck install pkg1.rpm pkg2.rpm ... 

    c.  Verify the packages are installed correctly:

            rpm -qa|egrep "lustre|wc"

    d.  Repeat these steps on each Lustre server.

7.  Download the Lustre client RPMs for your platform from the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository. See [???](#table.installed_client_pkg) for a list of
    required packages.

    ::: note
    The version of the kernel running on a Lustre client must be the
    same as the version of the `lustre-client-modules-` \<ver\>package
    being installed. If not, a compatible kernel must be installed on
    the client before the Lustre client packages are installed.
    :::

8.  Install the Lustre client packages on each of the Lustre clients to
    be upgraded.

    a.  Log onto a Lustre client as the `root` user.

    b.  Use the `yum` command to install the packages:

            # yum --nogpgcheck install pkg1.rpm pkg2.rpm ... 

    c.  Verify the packages were installed correctly:

            # rpm -qa|egrep "lustre|kernel"

    d.  Repeat these steps on each Lustre client.

9.  The DNE feature allows using multiple MDTs within a single
    filesystem namespace, and each MDT can each serve one or more remote
    sub-directories in the file system. The `root` directory is always
    located on MDT0.

    Note that clients running a release prior to the Lustre software
    release 2.4 can only see the namespace hosted by MDT0 and will
    return an IO error if an attempt is made to access a directory on
    another MDT.

    (Optional) To format an additional MDT, complete these steps:

    a.  Determine the index used for the first MDT (each MDT must have
        unique index). Enter:

            client$ lctl dl | grep mdc
            36 UP mdc lustre-MDT0000-mdc-ffff88004edf3c00 
                  4c8be054-144f-9359-b063-8477566eb84e 5

        In this example, the next available index is 1.

    b.  Format the new block device as a new MDT at the next available
        MDT index by entering (on one line):

            mds# mkfs.lustre --reformat --fsname=filesystem_name --mdt \
                --mgsnode=mgsnode --index new_mdt_index 
            /dev/mdt1_device

10. (Optional) If you are upgrading from a release before Lustre 2.10,
    to enable the project quota feature enter the following on every
    ldiskfs backend target while unmounted:

        tune2fs -O project /dev/dev

    ::: note
    Enabling the `project` feature will prevent the filesystem from
    being used by older versions of ldiskfs, so it should only be
    enabled if the project quota feature is required and/or after it is
    known that the upgraded release does not need to be downgraded.
    :::

11. When setting up the file system, enter:

        conf_param $FSNAME.quota.mdt=$QUOTA_TYPE
        conf_param $FSNAME.quota.ost=$QUOTA_TYPE

12. (Optional) If upgrading an ldiskfs MDT formatted prior to Lustre
    2.13, the \"wide striping\" feature that allows files to have more
    than 160 stripes and store other large xattrs was not enabled by
    default. This feature can be enabled on existing MDTs by running the
    following command on all MDT devices:

        mds# tune2fs -O ea_inode /dev/mdtdev

    For more information about wide striping, see [???](#wide_striping).

13. Start the Lustre file system by starting the components in the order
    shown in the following steps:

    a.  Mount the MGT. On the MGS, run

            mgs# mount -a -t lustre

    b.  Mount the MDT(s). On each MDT, run:

            mds# mount -a -t lustre

    c.  Mount all the OSTs. On each OSS node, run:

            oss# mount -a -t lustre

        ::: note
        This command assumes that all the OSTs are listed in the
        `/etc/fstab` file. OSTs that are not listed in the `/etc/fstab`
        file, must be mounted individually by running the mount command:

            mount -t lustre /dev/block_device/mount_point
        :::

    d.  Mount the file system on the clients. On each client node, run:

            client# mount -a -t lustre

14. (Optional) If you are upgrading from a release before Lustre 2.7, to
    enable OST FIDs to also store the OST index (to improve reliability
    of LFSCK and debug messages), *after* the OSTs are mounted run once
    on each OSS:

        oss# lctl set_param osd-ldiskfs.*.osd_index_in_idif=1

    ::: note
    Enabling the `index_in_idif` feature will prevent the OST from being
    used by older versions of Lustre, so it should only be enabled once
    it is known there is no need for the OST to be downgraded to an
    earlier release.
    :::

15. If a new MDT was added to the filesystem, the new MDT must be
    attached into the namespace by creating one or more *new* DNE
    subdirectories with the `lfs mkdir` command that use the new MDT:

        client# lfs mkdir -i new_mdt_index /testfs/new_dir

    In Lustre 2.8 and later, it is possible to split a new directory
    across multiple MDTs by creating it with multiple stripes:

        client# lfs mkdir -c 2 /testfs/new_striped_dir

    In Lustre 2.13 and later, it is possible to set the default
    directory layout on *existing* directories so new remote
    subdirectories are created on less-full MDTs:

        client# lfs setdirstripe -D -c 1 -i -1 /testfs/some_dir

    See [???](#lfsmkdirbyspace) for details.

    In Lustre 2.15 and later, if no default directory layout is set on
    the root directory, the MDS will *automatically* set the default
    directory layout the root directory to distribute the top-level
    directories round-robin across all MDTs, see [???](#fsdefaultlmv).

::: note
The mounting order described in the steps above must be followed for the
initial mount and registration of a Lustre file system after an upgrade.
For a normal start of a Lustre file system, the mounting order is MGT,
OSTs, MDT(s), clients.

## []{.indexterm primary="upgrading" secondary="2.X.y to 2.X.y (minor release)"}Upgrading to Lustre Software Release 2.x.y (Minor Release) {#Upgrading_2.x.x}

Rolling upgrades are supported for upgrading from any Lustre software
release 2.x.y to a more recent Lustre software release 2.X.y. This
allows the Lustre file system to continue to run while individual
servers (or their failover partners) and clients are upgraded one at a
time. The procedure for upgrading a Lustre software release 2.x.y to a
more recent minor release is described in this section.

To upgrade Lustre software release 2.x.y to a more recent minor release,
complete these steps:

1.  Create a complete, restorable file system backup.

    ::: caution
    Before installing the Lustre software, back up ALL data. The Lustre
    software contains kernel modifications that interact with storage
    devices and may introduce security issues and data loss if not
    installed, configured, or administered properly. If a full backup of
    the file system is not practical, a device-level backup of the MDT
    file system is recommended. See [???](#backupandrestore) for a
    procedure.
    :::

2.  Download the Lustre server RPMs for your platform from the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository. See [???](#table.installed_server_pkg) for a list of
    required packages.

3.  For a rolling upgrade, complete any procedures required to keep the
    Lustre file system running while the server to be upgraded is
    offline, such as failing over a primary server to its secondary
    partner.

4.  Unmount the Lustre server to be upgraded (MGS, MDS, or OSS)

5.  Install the Lustre server packages on the Lustre server.

    a.  Log onto the Lustre server as the `root` user

    b.  Use the `yum` command to install the packages:

            # yum --nogpgcheck install pkg1.rpm pkg2.rpm ... 

    c.  Verify the packages are installed correctly:

            rpm -qa|egrep "lustre|wc"

    d.  Mount the Lustre server to restart the Lustre software on the
        server:

            server# mount -a -t lustre

    e.  Repeat these steps on each Lustre server.

6.  Download the Lustre client RPMs for your platform from the [ Lustre
    Releases](https://wiki.whamcloud.com/display/PUB/Lustre+Releases)
    repository. See [???](#table.installed_client_pkg) for a list of
    required packages.

7.  Install the Lustre client packages on each of the Lustre clients to
    be upgraded.

    a.  Log onto a Lustre client as the `root` user.

    b.  Use the `yum` command to install the packages:

            # yum --nogpgcheck install pkg1.rpm pkg2.rpm ... 

    c.  Verify the packages were installed correctly:

            # rpm -qa|egrep "lustre|kernel"

    d.  Mount the Lustre client to restart the Lustre software on the
        client:

            client# mount -a -t lustre

    e.  Repeat these steps on each Lustre client.
