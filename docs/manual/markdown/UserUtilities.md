::: note
In the above example, the `/mount_point` parameter refers to the mount
point of the Lustre file system.

::: note
By default the `lfs quota` command provides aggregated cluster-wide
statistics. To obtain the detailed report of cluster-wide limits, usage
and statistics, use the `lfs quota -v` command. To see the detailed
report of per-user limits and usage, use the `lfs quota -a` command.

### Description

The `lfs` utility is used to create a new file with a specific striping
pattern, determine the default striping pattern, gather the layout
(object numbers and location) for a specific file, find files with
specific attributes, list OST information, or set quota limits. It can
be invoked interactively without any arguments, or in a non-interactive
mode with one of the supported arguments.

### Options

The various `lfs` options are described below. For a complete list of
available options, type help at the `lfs` prompt.

+-------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+
| **Option**  |                    | **Description**                   |
+=============+====================+===================================+
| `changelog` |                    | Shows the metadata changes on an  |
|             |                    | MDT. Start and end points are     |
|             |                    | optional. The `--follow` option   |
|             |                    | blocks on new changes; this       |
|             |                    | option is only valid when run     |
|             |                    | directly on the MDT node.         |
+-------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `chang      |                    | Indicates that changelog records  |
| elog_clear` |                    | previous to `endrec` are no       |
|             |                    | longer of interest to a           |
|             |                    | particular consumer `id`,         |
|             |                    | potentially allowing the MDT to   |
|             |                    | free up disk space. An `endrec`   |
|             |                    | of 0 indicates the current last   |
|             |                    | record. Changelog consumers must  |
|             |                    | be registered on the MDT node     |
|             |                    | using `lctl`.                     |
+-------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `check`     |                    | Displays the status of MDS or     |
|             |                    | OSTs (as specified in the         |
|             |                    | command) or all servers (MDS and  |
|             |                    | OSTs).                            |
+-------------+--------------------+-----------------------------------+
| `data_ve    |                    | Displays the current version of   |
| rsion [-nrw |                    | file data. If `-n` is specified,  |
| ] filename` |                    | the data version is read without  |
|             |                    | taking a lock. As a consequence,  |
|             |                    | the data version could be         |
|             |                    | outdated if there are dirty       |
|             |                    | caches on filesystem clients, but |
|             |                    | this option will not force data   |
|             |                    | flushes and has less of an impact |
|             |                    | on the filesystem. If `-r` is     |
|             |                    | specified, the data version is    |
|             |                    | read after dirty pages on clients |
|             |                    | are flushed. If `-w` is           |
|             |                    | specified, the data version is    |
|             |                    | read after all caching pages on   |
|             |                    | clients are flushed.              |
|             |                    |                                   |
|             |                    | Even with `-r` or `-w`, race      |
|             |                    | conditions are possible and the   |
|             |                    | data version should be checked    |
|             |                    | before and after an operation to  |
|             |                    | be confident the data did not     |
|             |                    | change during it.                 |
|             |                    |                                   |
|             |                    | The data version is the sum of    |
|             |                    | the last committed transaction    |
|             |                    | numbers of all data objects of a  |
|             |                    | file. It is used by HSM policy    |
|             |                    | engines for verifying that file   |
|             |                    | data has not been changed during  |
|             |                    | an archive operation or before a  |
|             |                    | release operation, and by OST     |
|             |                    | migration, primarily for          |
|             |                    | verifying that file data has not  |
|             |                    | been changed during a data copy,  |
|             |                    | when done in non-blocking mode.   |

|             |                    | reported. If the `-h` option is   |
|             |                    | included, the output is printed   |

|             |                    | when clients do read requests.    |
|             |                    | Permanent `atime` is written to   |

|             |                    | However, on-disk atime is only    |
|             |                    | updated if it is more than 60     |
|             |                    | seconds old (                     |

|             |                    | then it is updated on both the    |
|             |                    | MDT and OST, allowing the `atime` |

## []{.indexterm primary="lfs_migrate"} `lfs_migrate`

The `lfs_migrate` utility is a simple to migrate file *data* between
OSTs.

### Synopsis

    lfs_migrate [lfs_setstripe_options]
        [-h] [-n] [-q] [-R] [-s] [-y] [-0] [file|directory ...]

### Description

The `lfs_migrate` utility is a tool to assist migration of file data
between Lustre OSTs. The utility copies each specified file to a
temporary file using supplied `lfs setstripe` options, if any,
optionally verifies the file contents have not changed, and then swaps
the layout (OST objects) from the temporary file and the original file
(for Lustre 2.5 and later), or renames the temporary file to the
original filename. This allows the user/administrator to balance space
usage between OSTs, or move files off OSTs that are starting to show
hardware problems (though are still functional) or will be removed.

::: warning
For versions of Lustre before 2.5, `lfs_migrate` was not integrated with
the MDS at all. That made it UNSAFE for use on files that were being
modified by other applications, since the file was migrated through a
copy and rename of the file. With Lustre 2.5 and later, the new file
layout is swapped with the existing file layout, which ensures that the
user-visible inode number is kept, and open file handles and locks on
the file are kept.
:::

Files to be migrated can be specified as command-line arguments. If a
directory is specified on the command-line then all files within the
directory are migrated. If no files are specified on the command-line,
then a list of files is read from the standard input, making
`lfs_migrate` suitable for use with `lfs find` to locate files on
specific OSTs and/or matching other file attributes, and other tools
that generate a list of files on standard output.

Unless otherwise specified through command-line options, the file
allocation policies on the MDS dictate where the new files are placed,
taking into account whether specific OSTs have been disabled on the MDS
via `lctl` (preventing new files from being allocated there), whether
some OSTs are overly full (reducing the number of files placed on those
OSTs), or if there is a specific default file striping for the parent
directory (potentially changing the stripe count, stripe size, OST pool,
or OST index of a new file).

::: note
The `lfs_migrate` utility can also be used in some cases to reduce file
[]{.indexterm primary="fragmentation"}fragmentation. File fragmentation
will typically reduce Lustre file system performance. File fragmentation
may be observed on an aged file system and will commonly occur if the
file was written by many threads. Provided there is sufficient free
space (or if it was written when the file system was nearly full) that
is less fragmented than the file being copied, re-writing a file with
`lfs_migrate` will result in a migrated file with reduced fragmentation.
The tool `filefrag` can be used to report file fragmentation. See [
](#filefrag)
:::

::: note
As long as a file has extent lengths of tens of megabytes (
\<read_bandwidth \* seek_time\>) or more, the read performance for the
file will not be significantly impacted by fragmentation, since the read
pipeline can be filled by large reads from disk even with an occasional
disk seek.

## []{.indexterm primary="filefrag"} `filefrag`

The `e2fsprogs` package contains the `filefrag` tool which reports the
extent of file fragmentation.

### Synopsis

    filefrag [ -belsv ] [ files...  ]

### Description

The `filefrag` utility reports the extent of fragmentation in a given
file. The `filefrag` utility obtains the extent information from Lustre
files using the `FIEMAP ioctl`, which is efficient and fast, even for
very large files.

In default mode [^4], `filefrag` prints the number of physically
discontiguous extents in the file. In extent or verbose mode, each
extent is printed with details such as the blocks allocated on each OST.
For a Lustre file system, the extents are printed in device offset order
(i.e. all of the extents for one OST first, then the next OST, etc.),
not file logical offset order. If the file logical offset order was
used, the Lustre striping would make the output very verbose and
difficult to see if there was file fragmentation or not.

::: note
Note that as long as a file has extent lengths of tens of megabytes or
more (i.e. \<read_bandwidth \* seek_time \> extent_length\>), the read
performance for the file will not be significantly impacted by
fragmentation, since file readahead can fully utilize the disk disk
bandwidth even with occasional seeks.
:::

In default mode [^5], `filefrag` returns the number of physically
discontiguous extents in the file. In extent or verbose mode, each
extent is printed with details. For a Lustre file system, the extents
are printed in device offset order, not logical offset order.

### Options

|                                   | blocksize is used by the Lustre   |
|                                   | file system, since OSTs may use   |

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

## []{.indexterm primary="mount"} `mount`

The standard `mount(8)` Linux command is used to mount a Lustre file
system. When mounting a Lustre file system, mount(8) executes the
`/sbin/mount.lustre` command to complete the mount. The mount command
supports these options specific to a Lustre file system:

## Handling Timeouts {#handling_timeouts}

Timeouts are the most common cause of hung applications. After a timeout
involving an MDS or failover OST, applications attempting to access the
disconnected resource wait until the connection gets established.

When a client performs any remote operation, it gives the server a
reasonable amount of time to respond. If a server does not reply either
due to a down network, hung server, or any other reason, a timeout
occurs which requires a recovery.

If a timeout occurs, a message (similar to this one), appears on the
console of the client, and in `/var/log/messages`:

    LustreError: 26597:(client.c:810:ptlrpc_expire_one_request()) @@@ timeout

    req@a2d45200 x5886/t0 o38->mds_svc_UUID@NID_mds_UUID:12 lens 168/64 ref 1 fl

    RPC:/0/0 rc 0

[^1]: The file cannot exist prior to using `setstripe`. A directory must
    exist prior to using `setstripe`.

[^2]: The default stripe-size is 0. The default start-ost is -1. Do NOT
    confuse them! If you set start-ost to 0, all new file creations
    occur on OST 0 (seldom a good idea).

[^3]: The old `setquota` interface is supported, but it may be removed
    in a future Lustre software release.

[^4]: The default mode is faster than the verbose/extent mode since it
    only counts the number of extents.

[^5]: The default mode is faster than the verbose/extent mode.
