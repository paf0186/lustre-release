## []{.indexterm primary="High availability" see="failover"}[]{.indexterm primary="failover"}Setting Up a Failover Environment {#high_availability}

The Lustre software provides failover mechanisms only at the layer of
the Lustre file system. No failover functionality is provided for
system-level components such as failing hardware or applications, or
even for the entire failure of a node, as would typically be provided in
a complete failover solution. Failover functionality such as node
monitoring, failure detection, and resource fencing must be provided by
external HA software, such as PowerMan or the open source Corosync and
Pacemaker packages provided by Linux operating system vendors. Corosync
provides support for detecting failures, and Pacemaker provides the
actions to take once a failure has been detected.

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="power control device"}Selecting Power Equipment

Failover in a Lustre file system requires the use of a remote power
control (RPC) mechanism, which comes in different configurations. For
example, Lustre server nodes may be equipped with IPMI/BMC devices that
allow remote power control. For recommended devices, refer to the list
of supported RPC devices on the website for the PowerMan cluster power
management utility:

https://github.com/chaos/powerman/tree/master/etc/devices](https://github.com/chaos/powerman/tree/master/etc/devices)

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="power management software"}Selecting Power Management Software

Lustre failover requires RPC and management capability to verify that a
failed node is off before I/O is directed to the failover node. This
avoids double-mounting the two nodes and the risk of unrecoverable data
corruption. A variety of power management tools will work. Two packages
that have been commonly used with the Lustre software are PowerMan and
Pacemaker.

The PowerMan cluster power management utility is used to control RPC
devices from a central location. PowerMan provides native support for
several RPC varieties and Expect-like configuration simplifies the
addition of new devices. The latest versions of PowerMan are available
at:

STONITH, or \"Shoot The Other Node In The Head\" is used in conjunction
with High Availability node management. This is implemented by Pacemaker
to ensure that a peer node that may be importing a shared storage device
has been powered off and will not corrupt the shared storage if it
continues running.

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="high-availability (HA)  software"}Selecting High-Availability (HA) Software

The Lustre file system must be set up with high-availability (HA)
software to enable a complete Lustre failover solution. Except for
PowerMan, the HA software packages mentioned above provide both power
management and cluster management. For information about setting up
failover with Pacemaker, see:

    ](https://clusterlabs.org/)

## []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="setup"}Preparing a Lustre File System for Failover {#failover_setup}

To prepare a Lustre file system to be configured and managed as an HA
system by a third-party HA application, each storage target (MGT, MGS,
OST) must be associated with a second node to create a failover pair.
This configuration information is then communicated by the MGS to a
client when the client mounts the file system.

The per-target configuration is relayed to the MGS at mount time. Some
rules related to this are:

-   When a target is *initially* mounted, the MGS reads the
    configuration information from the target (such as mgt vs. ost,
    failnode, fsname) to configure the target into a Lustre file system.
    If the MGS is reading the initial mount configuration, the mounting
    node becomes that target\'s \"primary\" node.

-   When a target is [*subsequently*]{.underline} mounted, the MGS reads
    the current configuration from the target and, as needed, will
    reconfigure the MGS database target information

When the target is formatted using the `mkfs.lustre` command, the
failover service node(s) for the target are designated using the
`--servicenode` option. In the example below, an OST with index `0` in
the file system `testfs` is formatted with two service nodes designated
to serve as a failover pair:

    mkfs.lustre --reformat --ost --fsname testfs --mgsnode=192.168.10.1@o3ib \  
                  --index=0 --servicenode=192.168.10.7@o2ib \
                  --servicenode=192.168.10.8@o2ib \  
                  /dev/sdb

More than two potential service nodes can be designated for a target.
The target can then be mounted on any of the designated service nodes.

When HA is configured on a storage target, the Lustre software enables
multi-mount protection (MMP) on that storage target. MMP prevents
multiple nodes from simultaneously mounting and thus corrupting the data
on the target. For more about MMP, see [???](#managingfailover).

If the MGT has been formatted with multiple service nodes designated,
this information must be conveyed to the Lustre client in the mount
command used to mount the file system. In the example below, NIDs for
two MGSs that have been designated as service nodes for the MGT are
specified in the mount command executed on the client:

    mount -t lustre 10.10.120.1@tcp1:10.10.120.2@tcp1:/testfs /lustre/testfs

When a client mounts the file system, the MGS provides configuration
information to the client for the MDT(s) and OST(s) in the file system
along with the NIDs for all service nodes associated with each target
and the service node on which the target is mounted. Later, when the
client attempts to access data on a target, it will try the NID for each
specified service node until it connects to the target.
