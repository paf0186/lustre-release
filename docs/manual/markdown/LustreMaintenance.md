## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance"} []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="inactive OSTs"} Working with Inactive OSTs {#lustremaint.inactiveOST}

To mount a client or an MDT with one or more inactive OSTs, run commands
similar to this:

    client# mount -o exclude=testfs-OST0000 -t lustre \
               uml1:/testfs /mnt/testfs
                client# lctl get_param lov.testfs-clilov-*.target_obd

To activate an inactive OST on a live client or MDT, use the
`lctl activate` command on the OSC device. For example:

    lctl --device 7 activate

::: note
A colon-separated list can also be specified. For example,
`exclude=testfs-OST0000:testfs-OST0001`.
:::

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="finding nodes"} Finding Nodes in the Lustre File System {#lustremaint.findingNodes}

There may be situations in which you need to find all nodes in your
Lustre file system or get the names of all OSTs.

To get a list of all Lustre nodes, run this command on the MGS:

    # lctl get_param mgs.MGS.live.*

::: note
This command must be run on the MGS.
:::

In this example, file system `testfs` has three nodes, `testfs-MDT0000`,
`testfs-OST0000`, and `testfs-OST0001`.

    mgs:/root# lctl get_param mgs.MGS.live.* 
                    fsname: testfs 
                    flags: 0x0     gen: 26 
                    testfs-MDT0000 
                    testfs-OST0000 
                    testfs-OST0001 

To get the names of all OSTs, run this command on the MDS:

    mds:/root# lctl get_param lov.*-mdtlov.target_obd 

::: note
This command must be run on the MDS.
:::

In this example, there are two OSTs, testfs-OST0000 and testfs-OST0001,
which are both active.

    mgs:/root# lctl get_param lov.testfs-mdtlov.target_obd 
    0: testfs-OST0000_UUID ACTIVE 
    1: testfs-OST0001_UUID ACTIVE 

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="mounting a server"} Mounting a Server Without Lustre Service {#lustremaint.mountingServerWithoutLustre}

If you are using a combined MGS/MDT, but you only want to start the MGS
and not the MDT, run this command:

    mount -t lustre /dev/mdt_partition -o nosvc /mount_point

The `mdt_partition` variable is the combined MGS/MDT block device.

In this example, the combined MGS/MDT is `testfs-MDT0000` and the mount
point is `/mnt/test/mdt`.

    $ mount -t lustre -L testfs-MDT0000 -o nosvc /mnt/test/mdt

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="regenerating config logs"} Regenerating Lustre Configuration Logs {#lustremaint.regenerateConfigLogs}

If the Lustre file system configuration logs are in a state where the
file system cannot be started, use the `tunefs.lustre --writeconf`
command to regenerate them. After the `writeconf` command is run and the
servers restart, the configuration logs are re-generated and stored on
the MGS (as with a new file system).

You should only use the `writeconf` command if:

-   The configuration logs are in a state where the file system cannot
    start

-   A server NID is being changed

The `writeconf` command is destructive to some configuration items (e.g.
OST pools information and tunables set via `conf_param`), and should be
used with caution.

::: caution
The OST pools feature enables a group of OSTs to be named for file
striping purposes. If you use OST pools, be aware that running the
`writeconf` command erases **all** pools information (as well as any
other parameters set via `lctl conf_param`). We recommend that the pools
definitions (and `conf_param` settings) be executed via a script, so
they can be regenerated easily after `writeconf` is performed. However,
tunables saved with `lctl set_param -P` are *not* erased in this case.
:::

::: note
If the MGS still holds any configuration logs, it may be possible to
dump these logs to save any parameters stored with `lctl conf_param` by
dumping the config logs on the MGS and saving the output (once for each
MDT and OST device):

    mgs# lctl --device MGS llog_print fsname-client
    mgs# lctl --device MGS llog_print fsname-MDT0000
    mgs# lctl --device MGS llog_print fsname-OST0000
:::

To regenerate Lustre file system configuration logs:

1.  Stop the file system services in the following order before running
    the `tunefs.lustre --writeconf` command:

    1.  Unmount the clients.

    2.  Unmount the MDT(s).

    3.  Unmount the OST(s).

    4.  If the MGS is separate from the MDT it can remain mounted during
        this process.

2.  Make sure the MDT and OST devices are available.

3.  Run the `tunefs.lustre --writeconf` command on all target devices.

    Run writeconf on the MDT(s) first, and then the OST(s).

    1.  On each MDS, for each MDT run:

            mds# tunefs.lustre --writeconf /dev/mdt_device

    2.  On each OSS, for each OST run:

            oss# tunefs.lustre --writeconf /dev/ost_device

4.  Restart the file system in the following order:

    1.  Mount the separate MGT, if it is not already mounted.

    2.  Mount the MDT(s) in order, starting with MDT0000.

    3.  Mount the OSTs in order, starting with OST0000.

    4.  Mount the clients.

After the `tunefs.lustre --writeconf` command is run, the configuration
logs are re-generated as servers connect to the MGS.

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="changing a NID"} Changing a Server NID {#lustremaint.changingservernid}

In order to totally rewrite the Lustre configuration, the
`tunefs.lustre --writeconf` command is used to rewrite all of the
configuration files.

If you need to change only the NID of the MDT or OST, the `replace_nids`
command can simplify this process. The `replace_nids` command differs
from `tunefs.lustre --writeconf` in that it does not erase the entire
configuration log, precluding the need the need to execute the
`writeconf` command on all servers and re-specify all permanent
parameter settings. However, the `writeconf` command can still be used
if desired.

Change a server NID in these situations:

-   New server hardware is added to the file system, and the MDS or an
    OSS is being moved to the new machine.

-   New network card is installed in the server.

-   You want to reassign IP addresses.

To change a server NID:

1.  Update the LNet configuration in the `/etc/modprobe.conf` file so
    the list of server NIDs is correct. Use `lctl list_nids` to view the
    list of server NIDS.

    The `lctl list_nids` command indicates which network(s) are
    configured to work with the Lustre file system.

2.  Shut down the file system in this order:

    1.  Unmount the clients.

    2.  Unmount the MDT.

    3.  Unmount all OSTs.

3.  If the MGS and MDS share a partition, start the MGS only:

        mount -t lustre MDT partition -o nosvc mount_point

4.  Run the `replace_nids` command on the MGS:

        lctl replace_nids devicename nid1[,nid2,nid3 ...]

    where \<devicename\> is the Lustre target name, e.g.
    `testfs-OST0013`

5.  If the MGS and MDS share a partition, stop the MGS:

        umount mount_point

::: note
The `replace_nids` command also cleans all old, invalidated records out
of the configuration log, while preserving all other current settings.
:::

::: note
The previous configuration log is backed up on the MGS disk with the
suffix `'.bak'`.
:::

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="Clearing a config"} Clearing configuration {#lustremaint.clear_conf}

This command runs on MGS node having the MGS device mounted with
`-o nosvc.` It cleans up configuration files stored in the CONFIGS/
directory of any records marked SKIP. If the device name is given, then
the specific logs for that filesystem (e.g. testfs-MDT0000) are
processed. Otherwise, if a filesystem name is given then all
configuration files are cleared. The previous configuration log is
backed up on the MGS disk with the suffix \'config.timestamp.bak\'. Eg:
Lustre-MDT0000-1476454535.bak.

To clear a configuration:

1.  Shut down the file system in this order:

    1.  Unmount the clients.

    2.  Unmount the MDT.

    3.  Unmount all OSTs.

2.  If the MGS and MDS share a partition, start the MGS only using
    \"nosvc\" option.

        mount -t lustre MDT partition -o nosvc mount_point

3.  Run the `clear_conf` command on the MGS:

        lctl clear_conf config

    Example: To clear the configuration for `MDT0000` on a filesystem
    named `testfs`

        mgs# lctl clear_conf testfs-MDT0000

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="adding an MDT"}Adding a New MDT to a Lustre File System {#lustremaint.adding_new_mdt}

Additional MDTs can be added using the DNE feature to serve one or more
remote sub-directories within a filesystem, in order to increase the
total number of files that can be created in the filesystem, to increase
aggregate metadata performance, or to isolate user or application
workloads from other users of the filesystem. It is possible to have
multiple remote sub-directories reference the same MDT. However, the
root directory will always be located on MDT0000. To add a new MDT into
the file system:

1.  Discover the maximum MDT index. Each MDT must have unique index.

        client$ lctl dl | grep mdc
        36 UP mdc testfs-MDT0000-mdc-ffff88004edf3c00 4c8be054-144f-9359-b063-8477566eb84e 5
        37 UP mdc testfs-MDT0001-mdc-ffff88004edf3c00 4c8be054-144f-9359-b063-8477566eb84e 5
        38 UP mdc testfs-MDT0002-mdc-ffff88004edf3c00 4c8be054-144f-9359-b063-8477566eb84e 5
        39 UP mdc testfs-MDT0003-mdc-ffff88004edf3c00 4c8be054-144f-9359-b063-8477566eb84e 5

2.  Add the new block device as a new MDT at the next available index.
    In this example, the next available index is 4.

        mds# mkfs.lustre --reformat --fsname=testfs --mdt --mgsnode=mgsnode --index 4 /dev/mdt4_device

3.  Mount the MDTs.

        mds# mount -t lustre /dev/mdt4_blockdevice /mnt/mdt4

4.  In order to start creating new files and directories on the new
    MDT(s) they need to be attached into the namespace at one or more
    subdirectories using the `lfs mkdir` command. All files and
    directories below those created with `lfs mkdir` will also be
    created on the same MDT unless otherwise specified.

        client# lfs mkdir -i 3 /mnt/testfs/new_dir_on_mdt3
        client# lfs mkdir -i 4 /mnt/testfs/new_dir_on_mdt4
        client# lfs mkdir -c 4 /mnt/testfs/project/new_large_dir_striped_over_4_mdts

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="adding a OST"} Adding a New OST to a Lustre File System {#lustremaint.adding_new_ost}

A new OST can be added to existing Lustre file system on either an
existing OSS node or on a new OSS node. In order to keep client IO load
balanced across OSS nodes for maximum aggregate performance, it is not
recommended to configure different numbers of OSTs to each OSS node.

1.  Add a new OST by using `mkfs.lustre` as when the filesystem was
    first formatted, see [???](#format_ost) for details. Each new OST
    must have a unique index number, use `lctl dl` to see a list of all
    OSTs. For example, to add a new OST at index 12 to the `testfs`
    filesystem run following commands should be run on the OSS:

        oss# mkfs.lustre --fsname=testfs --mgsnode=mds16@tcp0 --ost --index=12 /dev/sda
        oss# mkdir -p /mnt/testfs/ost12
        oss# mount -t lustre /dev/sda /mnt/testfs/ost12

2.  Balance OST space usage (possibly).

    The file system can be quite unbalanced when new empty OSTs are
    added to a relatively full filesystem. New file creations are
    automatically balanced to favour the new OSTs. If this is a scratch
    file system or files are pruned at regular intervals, then no
    further work may be needed to balance the OST space usage as new
    files being created will preferentially be placed on the less full
    OST(s). As old files are deleted, they will release space on the old
    OST(s).

    Files existing prior to the expansion can optionally be rebalanced
    using the `lfs_migrate` utility. This redistributes file data over
    the entire set of OSTs.

    For example, to rebalance all files within the directory
    `/mnt/lustre/dir`, enter:

        client# lfs_migrate /mnt/lustre/dir

    To migrate files within the `/test` file system on `OST0004` that
    are larger than 4GB in size to other OSTs, enter:

        client# lfs find /test --ost test-OST0004 -size +4G | lfs_migrate -y

    See [???](#lfs_migrate) for details.

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="restoring an OST"} []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="removing an OST"} Removing and Restoring MDTs and OSTs {#lustremaint.deactivating_mdt_ost}

OSTs and DNE MDTs can be removed from and restored to a Lustre
filesystem. Deactivating an OST means that it is temporarily or
permanently marked unavailable. Deactivating an OST on the MDS means it
will not try to allocate new objects there or perform OST recovery,
while deactivating an OST the client means it will not wait for OST
recovery if it cannot contact the OST and will instead return an IO
error to the application immediately if files on the OST are accessed.
An OST may be permanently deactivated from the file system, depending on
the situation and commands used.

::: note
A permanently deactivated MDT or OST still appears in the filesystem
configuration until the configuration is regenerated with `writeconf` or
it is replaced with a new MDT or OST at the same index and permanently
reactivated. A deactivated OST will not be listed by `lfs df`.
:::

You may want to temporarily deactivate an OST on the MDS to prevent new
files from being written to it in several situations:

-   A hard drive has failed and a RAID resync/rebuild is underway,
    though the OST can also be marked *degraded* by the RAID system to
    avoid allocating new files on the slow OST which can reduce
    performance, see [???](#degraded_ost) for more details.

-   OST is nearing its space capacity, though the MDS will already try
    to avoid allocating new files on overly-full OSTs if possible, see
    [???](#balancing_free_space) for details.

-   MDT/OST storage or MDS/OSS node has failed, and will not be
    available for some time (or forever), but there is still a desire to
    continue using the filesystem before it is repaired.

### []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="removing an MDT"}Removing an MDT from the File System {#lustremaint.rmremotedir}

If the MDT is permanently inaccessible, `lfs rm_entry {directory}` can
be used to delete the directory entry for the unavailable MDT. Using
`rmdir` would otherwise report an IO error due to the remote MDT being
inactive. Please note that if the MDT *is* available, standard `rm -r`
should be used to delete the remote directory. After the remote
directory has been removed, the administrator should mark the MDT as
permanently inactive with:

    lctl conf_param {MDT name}.mdc.active=0

A user can identify which MDT holds a remote sub-directory using the
`lfs` utility. For example:

    client$ lfs getstripe --mdt-index /mnt/lustre/remote_dir1
    1
    client$ mkdir /mnt/lustre/local_dir0
    client$ lfs getstripe --mdt-index /mnt/lustre/local_dir0
    0

The `lfs getstripe --mdt-index` command returns the index of the MDT
that is serving the given directory.

### []{.indexterm primary="maintenance"} []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="inactive MDTs"}Working with Inactive MDTs {#lustremaint.inactivemdt}

Files located on or below an inactive MDT are inaccessible until the MDT
is activated again. Clients accessing an inactive MDT will receive an
EIO error.

### []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="removing an OST"}Removing an OST from the File System {#lustremaint.remove_ost}

When deactivating an OST, note that the client and MDS each have an OSC
device that handles communication with the corresponding OST. To remove
an OST from the file system:

1.  If the OST is functional, and there are files located on the OST
    that need to be migrated off of the OST, the file creation for that
    OST should be temporarily deactivated on the MDS (each MDS if
    running with multiple MDS nodes in DNE mode).

    1.  With Lustre 2.9 and later, the MDS should be set to only disable
        file creation on that OST by setting `max_create_count` to zero:

            mds# lctl set_param osp.osc_name.max_create_count=0

        This ensures that files deleted or migrated off of the OST will
        have their corresponding OST objects destroyed, and the space
        will be freed. For example, to disable `OST0000` in the
        filesystem `testfs`, run:

            mds# lctl set_param osp.testfs-OST0000-osc-MDT*.max_create_count=0

        on each MDS in the `testfs` filesystem.

    2.  With older versions of Lustre, to deactivate the OSC on the MDS
        node(s) use:

            mds# lctl set_param osp.osc_name.active=0

        This will prevent the MDS from attempting any communication with
        that OST, including destroying objects located thereon. This is
        fine if the OST will be removed permanently, if the OST is not
        stable in operation, or if it is in a read-only state.
        Otherwise, the free space and objects on the OST will not
        decrease when files are deleted, and object destruction will be
        deferred until the MDS reconnects to the OST.

        For example, to deactivate `OST0000` in the filesystem `testfs`,
        run:

            mds# lctl set_param osp.testfs-OST0000-osc-MDT*.active=0

        Deactivating the OST on the *MDS* does not prevent use of
        existing objects for read/write by a client.

        ::: note
        If migrating files from a working OST, do not deactivate the OST
        on clients. This causes IO errors when accessing files located
        there, and migrating files on the OST would fail.
        :::

        ::: caution
        Do not use `lctl set_param -P` or `lctl conf_param` to
        deactivate the OST if it is still working, as this immediately
        and permanently deactivates it in the file system configuration
        on both the MDS and all clients.
        :::

2.  Discover all files that have objects residing on the deactivated
    OST. Depending on whether the deactivated OST is available or not,
    the data from that OST may be migrated to other OSTs, or may need to
    be restored from backup.

    1.  If the OST is still online and available, find all files with
        objects on the deactivated OST, and copy them to other OSTs in
        the file system to:

            client# lfs find --ost ost_name /mount/point | lfs_migrate -y

        Note that if multiple OSTs are being deactivated at one time,
        the `lfs find` command can take multiple `--ost` arguments, and
        will return files that are located on *any* of the specified
        OSTs.

    2.  If the OST is no longer available, delete the files on that OST
        and restore them from backup:

            client# lfs find --ost ost_uuid -print0 /mount/point |
                    tee /tmp/files_to_restore | xargs -0 -n 1 unlink

        The list of files that need to be restored from backup is stored
        in `/tmp/files_to_restore`. Restoring these files is beyond the
        scope of this document.

3.  Deactivate the OST.

    1.  If there is expected to be a replacement OST in some short time
        (a few days), the OST can temporarily be deactivated on the
        clients using:

            client# lctl set_param osc.fsname-OSTnumber-*.active=0

        ::: note
        This setting is only temporary and will be reset if the clients
        are remounted or rebooted. It needs to be run on all clients.
        :::

    2.  If there is not expected to be a replacement for this OST in the
        near future, permanently deactivate it on all clients and the
        MDS by running the following command on the MGS:

            mgs# lctl conf_param ost_name.osc.active=0

        ::: note
        A deactivated OST still appears in the file system
        configuration, though a replacement OST can be created that
        re-uses the same OST index with the `mkfs.lustre --replace`
        option, see [ Restoring OST Configuration
        Files](#lustremaint.restore_ost).
        :::

        In Lustre 2.16 and later, it is possible to run the command
        \"`lctl del_ost --target fsname-OSTxxxx`\" on the MGS to totally
        remove an OST from the MGS configuration logs. This will cancel
        the configuration logs for that OST in the client and MDT
        configuration logs for the named filesystem. This permanently
        removes the configuration records for that OST from the
        filesystem, so that it will not be visible on later client and
        MDT mounts, and should only be run after earlier steps to
        migrate files off the OST.

        If the `del_ost` command is not available, the OST configuration
        records should be found in the startup logs by running the
        command \"`lctl --device MGS llog_print fsname-client`\" on the
        MGS (and also \"`... $fsname-MDTxxxx`\" for all the MDTs) to
        list all `attach`, `setup`, `add_osc`, `add_pool`, and other
        records related to the removed OST(s). Once the `index` value is
        known for each configuration record, the command
        \"`lctl --device MGS llog_cancel llog_name -i index`\" will drop
        that record from the configuration log \<llog_name\>. This is
        needed for each of `fsname-client` and `fsname-MDTxxxx`
        configuration logs so that new mounts will no longer process it.
        If a whole OSS is being removed, the`add_uuid` records for the
        OSS should similarly be canceled.

### []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="backing up OST config"} []{.indexterm primary="backup" secondary="OST config"} Backing Up OST Configuration Files {#lustremaint.ydg_pgt_tl}

If the OST device is still accessible, then the Lustre configuration
files on the OST should be backed up and saved for future use in order
to avoid difficulties when a replacement OST is returned to service.
These files rarely change, so they can and should be backed up while the
OST is functional and accessible. If the deactivated OST is still
available to mount (i.e. has not permanently failed or is unmountable
due to severe corruption), an effort should be made to preserve these
files.

1.  Mount the OST file system.

        oss# mkdir -p /mnt/ost
        oss# mount -t ldiskfs /dev/ost_device /mnt/ost

2.  Back up the OST configuration files.

        oss# tar cvf ost_name.tar -C /mnt/ost last_rcvd \
                   CONFIGS/ O/0/LAST_ID

3.  Unmount the OST file system.

        oss# umount /mnt/ost

### []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="restoring OST config"} []{.indexterm primary="backup" secondary="restoring OST config"} Restoring OST Configuration Files {#lustremaint.restore_ost}

If the original OST is still available, it is best to follow the OST
backup and restore procedure given in either [???](#backup_device), or
[???](#backup_fs_level) and [???](#backup_fs_level.restore).

To replace an OST that was removed from service due to corruption or
hardware failure, the replacement OST needs to be formatted using
`mkfs.lustre`, and the Lustre file system configuration should be
restored, if available. Any objects stored on the OST will be
permanently lost, and files using the OST should be deleted and/or
restored from backup.

With Lustre 2.5 and later, it is possible to replace an OST to the same
index without restoring the configuration files, using the `--replace`
option at format time.

    oss# mkfs.lustre --ost --reformat --replace --index=old_ost_index \
            other_options /dev/new_ost_dev

The MDS and OSS will negotiate the `LAST_ID` value for the replacement
OST.

If the OST configuration files were not backed up, due to the OST file
system being completely inaccessible, it is still possible to replace
the failed OST with a new one at the same OST index.

1.  For older versions, format the OST file system without the
    `--replace` option and restore the saved configuration:

        oss# mkfs.lustre --ost --reformat --index=old_ost_index \
                   other_options /dev/new_ost_dev

2.  Mount the OST file system.

        oss# mkdir /mnt/ost
        oss# mount -t ldiskfs /dev/new_ost_dev /mnt/ost

3.  Restore the OST configuration files, if available.

        oss# tar xvf ost_name.tar -C /mnt/ost

4.  Recreate the OST configuration files, if unavailable.

    Follow the procedure in [???](#repair_ost_lastid) to recreate the
    LAST_ID file for this OST index. The `last_rcvd` file will be
    recreated when the OST is first mounted using the default
    parameters, which are normally correct for all file systems. The
    `CONFIGS/mountdata` file is created by `mkfs.lustre` at format time,
    but has flags set that request it to register itself with the MGS.
    It is possible to copy the flags from another working OST (which
    should be the same):

        oss1# debugfs -c -R "dump CONFIGS/mountdata /tmp" /dev/other_osdev
        oss1# scp /tmp/mountdata oss0:/tmp/mountdata
        oss0# dd if=/tmp/mountdata of=/mnt/ost/CONFIGS/mountdata bs=4 count=1 seek=5 skip=5 conv=notrunc

5.  Unmount the OST file system.

        oss# umount /mnt/ost

### []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="reintroducing an OSTs"}Returning a Deactivated OST to Service {#lustremaint.ucf_qgt_tl}

If the OST was permanently deactivated, it needs to be reactivated in
the MGS configuration.

    mgs# lctl conf_param ost_name.osc.active=1

If the OST was temporarily deactivated, it needs to be reactivated on
the MDS and clients.

    mds# lctl set_param osp.fsname-OSTnumber-*.active=1
    client# lctl set_param osc.fsname-OSTnumber-*.active=1

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="aborting recovery"} []{.indexterm primary="backup" secondary="aborting recovery"} Aborting Recovery {#lustremaint.abortRecovery}

You can abort recovery with either the `lctl` utility or by mounting the
target with the `abort_recov` option (`mount -o abort_recov`). When
starting a target, run:

    mds# mount -t lustre -L mdt_name -o abort_recov /mount_point

::: note
The recovery process is blocked until all OSTs are available.

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="identifying OST host"} Determining Which Machine is Serving an OST {#lustremaint.determineOST}

In the course of administering a Lustre file system, you may need to
determine which machine is serving a specific OST. It is not as simple
as identifying the machine\'s IP address, as IP is only one of several
networking protocols that the Lustre software uses and, as such, LNet
does not use IP addresses as node identifiers, but NIDs instead. To
identify the NID that is serving a specific OST, run one of the
following commands on a client (you do not need to be a root user):

    client$ lctl get_param osc.fsname-OSTnumber*.ost_conn_uuid

For example:

    client$ lctl get_param osc.*-OST0000*.ost_conn_uuid 
    osc.testfs-OST0000-osc-f1579000.ost_conn_uuid=192.168.20.1@tcp

\- OR -

    client$ lctl get_param osc.*.ost_conn_uuid 
    osc.testfs-OST0000-osc-f1579000.ost_conn_uuid=192.168.20.1@tcp
    osc.testfs-OST0001-osc-f1579000.ost_conn_uuid=192.168.20.1@tcp
    osc.testfs-OST0002-osc-f1579000.ost_conn_uuid=192.168.20.1@tcp
    osc.testfs-OST0003-osc-f1579000.ost_conn_uuid=192.168.20.1@tcp
    osc.testfs-OST0004-osc-f1579000.ost_conn_uuid=192.168.20.1@tcp

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="changing failover node address"} Changing the Address of a Failover Node {#lustremaint.ChangeAddrFailoverNode}

To change the address of a failover node (e.g, to use node X instead of
node Y), run this command on the OSS/OST partition (depending on which
option was used to originally identify the NID):

    oss# tunefs.lustre --erase-params --servicenode=NID /dev/ost_device

or

    oss# tunefs.lustre --erase-params --failnode=NID /dev/ost_device

For more information about the `--servicenode` and `--failnode` options,
see [???](#configuringfailover).

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="separate a
        combined MGS/MDT"} Separate a combined MGS/MDT {#lustremaint.seperateCombinedMGSMDT}

These instructions assume the MGS node will be the same as the MDS node.
For instructions on how to move MGS to a different node, see [ Changing
a Server NID](#lustremaint.changingservernid).

These instructions are for doing the split without shutting down other
servers and clients.

1.  Stop the MDS.

    Unmount the MDT

        mds# umount -f /dev/mdt_device
                    

2.  Create the MGT filesystem.

        mds# mkfs.lustre --mgs /dev/mgt_device
                    

3.  Copy the configuration data from MDT disk to the new MGT disk.

        mds# mount -t ldiskfs -o ro /dev/mdt_device /mdt_mount_point
        mds# mount -t ldiskfs -o rw /dev/mgt_device /mgt_mount_point
        mds# cp -av /mdt_mount_point/CONFIGS/filesystem_name-* /mgt_mount_point/CONFIGS/
        mds# cp -av /mdt_mount_point/CONFIGS/{params,nodemap,sptlrpc}* /mgt_mount_point/CONFIGS/
        mds# umount /mgt_mount_point
        mds# umount /mdt_mount_point
                      

    See [ Regenerating Lustre Configuration
    Logs](#lustremaint.regenerateConfigLogs) for alternative method.

4.  Start the MGS.

        mgs# mount -t lustre /dev/mgt_device /mgt_mount_point
                    

    Check to make sure it knows about all your file system

        mgs:/root# lctl get_param mgs.MGS.filesystems

5.  Remove the MGS option from the MDT, and set the new MGS nid.

        mds# tunefs.lustre --nomgs --mgsnode=new_mgs_nid /dev/mdt-device
                    

6.  Start the MDT.

        mds# mount -t lustre /dev/mdt_device /mdt_mount_point
                      

    Check to make sure the MGS configuration looks right:

        mgs# lctl get_param mgs.MGS.live.filesystem_name

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="set an MDT to readonly"} Set an MDT to read-only {#lustremaint.setMDTReadonly}

It is sometimes desirable to be able to mark the filesystem read-only
directly on the server, rather than remounting the clients and setting
the option there. This can be useful if there is a rogue client that is
deleting files, or when decommissioning a system to prevent
already-mounted clients from modifying it anymore.

Set the `mdt.*.readonly` parameter to `1` to immediately set the MDT to
read-only. All future MDT access will immediately return a \"Read-only
file system\" error (`EROFS`) until the parameter is set to `0` again.

Example of setting the `readonly` parameter to `1`, verifying the
current setting, accessing from a client, and setting the parameter back
to `0`:

    mds# lctl set_param mdt.fs-MDT0000.readonly=1
    mdt.fs-MDT0000.readonly=1

    mds# lctl get_param mdt.fs-MDT0000.readonly
    mdt.fs-MDT0000.readonly=1

    client$ touch test_file
    touch: cannot touch 'test_file': Read-only file system

    mds# lctl set_param mdt.fs-MDT0000.readonly=0
    mdt.fs-MDT0000.readonly=0

## []{.indexterm primary="maintenance" secondary="Tune fallocate"} Tune Fallocate for ldiskfs {#lustremaint.tunefallocate}

This section shows how to tune/enable/disable fallocate for ldiskfs
OSTs.

The default `mode=0` is the standard \"allocate unwritten extents\"
behavior used by ext4. This is by far the fastest for space allocation,
but requires the unwritten extents to be split and/or zeroed when they
are overwritten.

The OST fallocate `mode=1` can also be set to use \"zeroed extents\",
which may be handled by \"WRITE SAME\", \"TRIM zeroes data\", or other
low-level functionality in the underlying block device.

`mode=-1` completely disables fallocate.

Example: To completely disable fallocate

    lctl set_param osd-ldiskfs.*.fallocate_zero_blocks=-1

Example: To enable fallocate to use \'zeroed extents\'

    lctl set_param osd-ldiskfs.*.fallocate_zero_blocks=1
