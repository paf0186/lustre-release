## []{.indexterm primary="change logs" see="monitoring"} []{.indexterm primary="monitoring"} []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="change logs"} Lustre Changelogs {#lustre_changelogs}

The changelogs feature records events that change the file system
namespace or file metadata. Changes such as file creation, deletion,
renaming, attribute changes, etc. are recorded with the target and
parent file identifiers (FIDs), the name of the target, a timestamp, and
user information. These records can be used for a variety of purposes:

-   Capture recent changes to feed into an archiving system.

-   Use changelog entries to exactly replicate changes in a file system
    mirror.

-   Set up \"watch scripts\" that take action on certain events or
    directories.

-   Audit activity on Lustre, thanks to user information associated to
    file/directory changes with timestamps.

Changelogs record types are:

map target and parent FIDs into the file system namespace.

### []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="change logs
    "} Working with Changelogs

Several commands are available to work with changelogs.

#### `lctl changelog_register`

Because changelog records take up space on the MDT, the system
administration must register changelog users. As soon as a changelog
user is registered, the Changelogs feature is enabled. Users specify
which records they have *finished processing*, and the system purges up
to the greatest common processed record.

To register a new changelog user, for each MDT run:

    mds# lctl --device FSNAME-MDTxxxx changelog_register \
        --user USERNAME --mask RECORD_TYPES

The \<USERNAME\> is a descriptive ASCII string up to 16 characters that
allows identifying registered changelog users more easily, and is
combined with a unique identifier.

The \<RECORD_TYPES\> is a comma-separated list of the above record types
that this user is interested in. The per-user mask is combined with
other user masks to form the global `changelog_mask` of all record types
that are saved. By registering a per-user mask instead of modifying the
global `changelog_mask` the changelog will record only the minimal set
of record types that are needed by the currently-registered users.

Changelog entries are not purged beyond a registered user\'s set point
(see `lfs changelog_clear`).

#### `lfs changelog`

To display the metadata changes on an MDT (the changelog records), run:

    client# lfs changelog fsname-MDTnumber [startrec [endrec]]

It is optional whether to specify the start and end records.

These are sample changelog records:

    1 02MKDIR 15:15:21.977666834 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] j=mkdir.500 ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000007:0x1:0x0] pics
    2 01CREAT 15:15:36.687592024 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402:0x2:0x0] j=cp.500 ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg
    3 06UNLNK 15:15:41.305116815 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402:0x2:0x0] j=rm.500 ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg
    4 07RMDIR 15:15:46.468790091 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] j=rmdir.500 ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000007:0x1:0x0] pics

#### `lfs changelog_clear`

To clear old changelog records for a specific user (records that the
user no longer needs), run:

    client# lfs changelog_clear mdt_name userid endrec

The `changelog_clear` command indicates that changelog records previous
to \<endrec\> are no longer of interest to a particular user \<userid\>,
potentially allowing the MDT to free up disk space. An `endrec` value of
0 indicates the current last record. To run `changelog_clear`, the
changelog user must be registered on the MDT node using `lctl`.

When all changelog users are done with records \< X, the records are
deleted.

#### `lctl changelog_deregister [USERID|--user USERNAME]`

To deregister (unregister) a changelog user, run:

    mds# lctl --device mdt_device changelog_deregister USERID

If \<USERID\> is specified, this matches only the exact user ID string
that was returned when `changelog_register` was called. If \<USERNAME\>
is specified, then it will match a changelog username beginning with
\<USERNAME\>, to simplify automatic deregistering a service user
registered by name from a script, rather than having to know the exact
username.

Running `changelog_deregister cl1` effectively does a
`lfs changelog_clear cl1 0` as it deregisters.

### Changelog Examples

This section provides examples of different changelog commands.

#### Registering a Changelog User

To register a new \"monitor\" user for a device (`lustre-MDT0000`):

    mds# lctl --device lustre-MDT0000 changelog_register --user monitor \
       --mask UNLNK,CLOSE
    lustre-MDT0000: Registered changelog userid 'monitor-cl1'

#### Displaying Changelog Records

To display changelog records for an MDT (e.g. `lustre-MDT0000`):

    client# lfs changelog lustre-MDT0000
    1 02MKDIR 15:15:21.977666834 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] ef=0xf \

    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg
    3 06UNLNK 15:15:41.305116815 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402:0x2:0x0] ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg
    4 07RMDIR 15:15:46.468790091 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000007:0x1:0x0] pics

Changelog records include this information:

    rec# operation_type(numerical/text) timestamp datestamp flags
    t=target_FID ef=extended_flags u=uid:gid nid=client_NID p=parent_FID target_name

Displayed in this format:

    rec# operation_type(numerical/text) timestamp datestamp flags t=target_FID \
    ef=extended_flags u=uid:gid nid=client_NID p=parent_FID target_name

For example:

    2 01CREAT 15:15:36.687592024 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402:0x2:0x0] ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] chloe.jpg

#### Clearing Changelog Records

To notify a device that a specific user (`monitor-cl1`) no longer needs
records (up to and including 3):

    # lfs changelog_clear lustre-MDT0000 monitor-cl1 3

To confirm that the `changelog_clear` operation was successful, run
`lfs changelog`; only records after id-3 are listed:

    # lfs changelog lustre-MDT0000
    4 07RMDIR 15:15:46.468790091 2018.01.09 0x1 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp p=[0x200000007:0x1:0x0] pics

#### Deregistering a Changelog User

To deregister a changelog user (`monitor-cl1`) for a specific device
(`lustre-MDT0000`):

    mds# lctl --device lustre-MDT0000 changelog_deregister --user monitor
    lustre-MDT0000: Deregistered changelog user 'monitor-cl1'

The deregistration operation clears all changelog records for the
specified user (`monitor-cl1`).

    client# lfs changelog lustre-MDT0000
    5 00MARK  15:56:39.603643887 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x20001:0x0:0x0] ef=0xf \
    u=500:500 nid=0@<0:0> p=[0:0x50:0xb] mdd_obd-lustre-MDT0000-0

::: note
MARK records typically indicate changelog recording status changes.
:::

#### Displaying the Changelog Index and Registered Users

To display the current, maximum changelog index and registered changelog
users for a specific device (`lustre-MDT0000`):

    mds# lctl get_param mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_users
    mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_users=current index: 8
    ID    index (idle seconds)
    audit-cl2   8 (180)

#### Displaying the Changelog Mask

To show the current changelog mask on a specific device
(`lustre-MDT0000`):

    mds# lctl get_param mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_mask
    mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_mask=MARK UNLNK CLOSE 

#### Setting the Changelog Mask {#modifyChangelogMask}

To set the current changelog mask on a specific device
(`lustre-MDT0000`):

    mds# lctl set_param mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_mask=HLINK
    mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_mask=HLINK
    $ lfs changelog_clear lustre-MDT0000 cl1 0
    $ mkdir /mnt/lustre/mydir/foo
    $ cp /etc/hosts /mnt/lustre/mydir/foo/file
    $ ln /mnt/lustre/mydir/foo/file /mnt/lustre/mydir/myhardlink

::: note
Note that setting `changelog_mask` explicitly is deprecated and using
the `--mask` argument when registering a new user is preferred.
:::

Only item types that are in the mask appear in the changelog.

    # lfs changelog lustre-MDT0000
    9 03HLINK 16:06:35.291636498 2018.01.09 0x0 t=[0x200000402:0x4:0x0] ef=0xf \

### []{.indexterm primary="audit" secondary="change logs"} Audit with Changelogs

A specific use case for Lustre Changelogs is audit. According to a
definition found on [
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_technology_audit),
information technology audits are used to evaluate the organization\'s
ability to protect its information assets and to properly dispense
information to authorized parties. Basically, audit consists in
controlling that all data accesses made were done according to the
access control policy in place. And usually, this is done by analyzing
access logs.

Audit can be used as a proof of security in place. But Audit can also be
a requirement to comply with regulations.

Lustre Changelogs are a good mechanism for audit, because this is a
centralized facility, and it is designed to be transactional. Changelog
records contain all information necessary for auditing purposes:

-   ability to identify object of action thanks to file identifiers
    (FIDs) and name of targets

-   ability to identify subject of action thanks to UID/GID and NID
    information

-   ability to identify time of action thanks to timestamp

#### Enabling Audit

To have a fully functional Changelogs-based audit facility, some
additional Changelog record types must be enabled, to be able to record
events such as OPEN, ATIME, GETXATTR and DENIED OPEN. Please note that
enabling these record types may have some performance impact. For
instance, recording OPEN and GETXATTR events generate writes in the
Changelog records for a read operation from a file-system standpoint.

Being able to record events such as OPEN or DENIED OPEN is important
from an audit perspective. For instance, if Lustre file system is used
to store medical records on a system dedicated to Life Sciences, data
privacy is crucial. Administrators may need to know which doctors
accessed, or tried to access, a given medical record and when. And
conversely, they might need to know which medical records a given doctor
accessed.

To enable all changelog entry types, do:

    mds# lctl set_param mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_mask=ALL
    mdd.seb-MDT0000.changelog_mask=ALL

Once all required record types have been enabled, just register a
Changelogs user and the audit facility is operational.

Note that, however, it is possible to control which Lustre client nodes
can trigger the recording of file system access events to the
Changelogs, thanks to the `audit_mode` flag on nodemap entries. The
reason to disable audit on a per-nodemap basis is to prevent some nodes
(e.g. backup, HSM agent nodes) from flooding the audit logs. When
`audit_mode` flag is set to 1 on a nodemap entry, a client pertaining to
this nodemap will be able to record file system access events to the
Changelogs, if Changelogs are otherwise activated. When set to 0, events
are not logged into the Changelogs, no matter if Changelogs are
activated or not. By default, `audit_mode` flag is set to 1 in newly
created nodemap entries. And it is also set to 1 in \'default\' nodemap.

To prevent nodes pertaining to a nodemap to generate Changelog entries,
do:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_modify --name nm1 --property audit_mode --value 0

#### Audit examples

##### `OPEN`

An OPEN changelog entry is in the form:

    7 10OPEN  13:38:51.510728296 2017.07.25 0x242 t=[0x200000401:0x2:0x0] \
    ef=0x7 u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp m=-w-

It includes information about the open mode, in the form m=rwx.

OPEN entries are recorded only once per UID/GID, for a given open mode,
as long as the file is not closed by this UID/GID. It avoids flooding
the Changelogs for instance if there is an MPI job opening the same file
thousands of times from different threads. It reduces the ChangeLog load
significantly, without significantly affecting the audit information.
Similarly, only the last CLOSE per UID/GID is recorded.

##### `GETXATTR`

A GETXATTR changelog entry is in the form:

    8 23GXATR 09:22:55.886793012 2017.07.27 0x0 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] \
    ef=0xf u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp x=user.name0

It includes information about the name of the extended attribute being
accessed, in the form `x=<xattr name>`.

##### `SETXATTR`

A SETXATTR changelog entry is in the form:

    4 15XATTR 09:41:36.157333594 2018.01.10 0x0 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] \
    ef=0xf u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.159@tcp x=user.name0

It includes information about the name of the extended attribute being
modified, in the form `x=<xattr name>`.

##### `DENIED OPEN`

A DENIED OPEN changelog entry is in the form:

    4 24NOPEN 15:45:44.947406626 2017.08.31 0x2 t=[0x200000402:0x1:0x0] \
    ef=0xf u=500:500 nid=10.128.11.158@tcp m=-w-

It has the same information as a regular OPEN entry. In order to avoid
flooding the Changelogs, DENIED OPEN entries are rate limited: no more
than one entry per user per file per time interval, this time interval
(in seconds) being configurable via `mdd.<mdtname>.changelog_deniednext`
(default value is 60 seconds).

    mds# lctl set_param mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_deniednext=120
    mdd.seb-MDT0000.changelog_deniednext=120
    mds# lctl get_param mdd.lustre-MDT0000.changelog_deniednext
    mdd.seb-MDT0000.changelog_deniednext=120

## []{.indexterm primary="jobstats" see="monitoring"} []{.indexterm primary="monitoring"} []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="jobstats"} Lustre Jobstats {#jobstats}

The Lustre jobstats feature collects file system operation statistics
for user processes running on Lustre clients, and exposes on the server
using the unique Job Identifier (JobID) provided by the job scheduler
for each job. Job schedulers known to be able to work with jobstats
include: SLURM, SGE, LSF, Loadleveler, PBS and Maui/MOAB.

Since jobstats is implemented in a scheduler-agnostic manner, it is
likely that it will be able to work with other schedulers also, and also
in environments that do not use a job scheduler, by storing custom
format strings in the `jobid_name`.

### []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="jobstats"} How Jobstats Works

The Lustre jobstats code on the client extracts the unique JobID from an
environment variable within the user process, and sends this JobID to
the server with all RPCs. This allows the server to tracks statistics
for operations specific to each application/command running on the
client, and can be useful to identify the source high I/O load.

A Lustre setting on the client, `jobid_var`, specifies an environment
variable or other client-local source that to holds a (relatively)
unique the JobID for the running application. Any environment variable
can be specified. For example, SLURM sets the `SLURM_JOB_ID` environment
variable with the unique JobID for all clients running a particular job
launched on one or more nodes, and the `SLURM_JOB_ID` will be inherited
by all child processes started below that process.

There are several reserved values for `jobid_var`:

-   `disable` - disables sending a JobID from this client

-   `procname_uid` - uses the process name and UID, equivalent to
    setting `jobid_name=%e.%u`

-   `nodelocal` - use only the JobID format from `jobid_name`

-   `session` - extract the JobID from `jobid_this_session`

Lustre can also be configured to generate a synthetic JobID from the
client\'s process name and numeric UID, by setting
`jobid_var=procname_uid`. This will generate a uniform JobID when
running the same binary across multiple client nodes, but cannot
distinguish whether the binary is part of a single distributed process
or multiple independent processes. This can be useful on login nodes
where interactive commands are run.

In Lustre 2.8 and later it is possible to set `jobid_var=nodelocal` and
then also set `jobid_name=`\<name\>, which *all* processes on that
client node will use. This is useful if only a single job is run on a
client at one time, but if multiple jobs are run on a client
concurrently, the `session` JobID should be used.

In Lustre 2.12 and later, it is possible to specify more complex JobID
values for `jobid_name` by using a string that contains format codes
that are evaluated for each process, in order to generate a site- or
node-specific JobID string.

-   `%e` Print executable name.

-   `%g` Print group ID number.

-   `%h` Print fully-qualified hostname.

-   `%H` Print short hostname (preferred over `%h`).

-   `%j` Print JobID from the environment variable named by the
    `jobid_var` parameter. If `%j?` is specified then conditionally use
    the following format if `jobid_var` is empty.

-   `%p` print numeric process ID

-   `%u` print user ID number

In Lustre 2.13 and later, it is possible to set a per-session JobID via
the `jobid_this_session` parameter *instead* of getting the JobID from
an environment variable. This session ID will be inherited by all
processes that are started in this login session, though there can be a
different JobID for each login session. This is enabled by setting
`jobid_var=session` instead of setting it to an environment variable.
The session ID will be substituted for `%j` in `jobid_name`.

The setting of `jobid_var` need not be the same on all clients. For
example, one could use `SLURM_JOB_ID` on all clients managed by SLURM,
and use `procname_uid` on clients not managed by SLURM, such as
interactive login nodes.

It is not possible to have different `jobid_var` settings on a single
node, since it is unlikely that multiple job schedulers are active on
one client. However, the actual JobID value is local to each process
environment and it is possible for multiple jobs with different JobIDs
to be active on a single client at one time.

In Lustre 2.16 and later, it is possible to specify the `%j?`
conditional format operator. If `jobid_var` cannot be found in the
environment (e.g. process is run outside of the job scheduler), then the
format immediately following `%j?` is used *instead* of `%j`. This is
useful on nodes that may have processes accessing the filesystem outside
of the batch-scheduled process group. For example, `%j?%H` will resolve
to only `jobid_var` if it exists in the environment and is not empty,
otherwise it will resolve to the short hostname.

### []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="jobstats"} Enable/Disable Jobstats

Jobstats are disabled by default. The current state of jobstats can be
verified by checking `lctl get_param jobid_var` on a client:

    clieht# lctl get_param jobid_var
    jobid_var=disable

To enable jobstats on all clients for SLURM:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P jobid_var=SLURM_JOB_ID

The `lctl set_param` command to enable or disable jobstats should be run
on the MGS as root. The change is persistent, and will be propagated to
the MDS, OSS, and client nodes automatically when it is set on the MGS
and for each new client mount.

To temporarily enable jobstats on a client, or to use a different
jobid_var on a subset of nodes, such as nodes in a remote cluster that
use a different job scheduler, or interactive login nodes that do not
use a job scheduler at all, run the `lctl set_param` command directly on
the client node(s) after the filesystem is mounted. For example, to
enable the `procname_uid` synthetic JobID locally on a login node run:

    client# lctl set_param jobid_var=procname_uid

The `lctl set_param` setting is not persistent, and will be reset if the
global `jobid_var` is set on the MGS or if the filesystem is unmounted.

The following table shows the environment variables which are set by
various job schedulers. Set `jobid_var` to the value for your job
scheduler to collect statistics on a per job basis.

    mgs# lctl set_param -P jobid_var=disable

To track job stats per process name and user ID (for debugging, or if no
job scheduler is in use on some nodes such as login nodes), specify
`jobid_var` as `procname_uid`:

    client# lctl set_param jobid_var=procname_uid

### []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="jobstats"} Check Job Stats

Metadata operation statistics are collected on MDTs. These statistics
can be accessed for all file systems and all jobs on the MDT via the
`lctl get_param mdt.*.job_stats`. For example, clients running with
`jobid_var=procname_uid`:

    mds# lctl get_param mdt.*.job_stats
    job_stats:
    - job_id:          bash.0
      snapshot_time:   1352084992
      open:            { samples:     2, unit:  reqs }
      close:           { samples:     2, unit:  reqs }
      getattr:         { samples:     3, unit:  reqs }
    - job_id:          mythbackend.0
      snapshot_time:   1352084996
      open:            { samples:    72, unit:  reqs }
      close:           { samples:    73, unit:  reqs }
      unlink:          { samples:    22, unit:  reqs }
      getattr:         { samples:   778, unit:  reqs }
      setattr:         { samples:    22, unit:  reqs }
      statfs:          { samples: 19840, unit:  reqs }
      sync:            { samples: 33190, unit:  reqs }

Data operation statistics are collected on OSTs. Data operations
statistics can be accessed via `lctl get_param obdfilter.*.job_stats`,
for example:

    oss# lctl get_param obdfilter.*.job_stats
    obdfilter.myth-OST0000.job_stats=
    job_stats:
    - job_id:          mythcommflag.0
      snapshot_time:   1429714922
      read:    { samples: 974, unit: bytes, min: 4096, max: 1048576, sum: 91530035 }
      write:   { samples:   0, unit: bytes, min:    0, max:       0, sum:        0 }
    obdfilter.myth-OST0001.job_stats=
    job_stats:
    - job_id:          mythbackend.0
      snapshot_time:   1429715270
      read:    { samples:   0, unit: bytes, min:     0, max:      0, sum:        0 }
      write:   { samples:   1, unit: bytes, min: 96899, max:  96899, sum:    96899 }
      punch:   { samples:   1, unit:  reqs }
    obdfilter.myth-OST0002.job_stats=job_stats:
    obdfilter.myth-OST0003.job_stats=job_stats:
    obdfilter.myth-OST0004.job_stats=
    job_stats:
    - job_id:          mythfrontend.500
      snapshot_time:   1429692083
      read:    { samples:   9, unit: bytes, min: 16384, max: 1048576, sum: 4444160 }
      write:   { samples:   0, unit: bytes, min:     0, max:       0, sum:       0 }
    - job_id:          mythbackend.500
      snapshot_time:   1429692129
      read:    { samples:   0, unit: bytes, min:     0, max:       0, sum:       0 }
      write:   { samples:   1, unit: bytes, min: 56231, max:   56231, sum:   56231 }
      punch:   { samples:   1, unit:  reqs }

### []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="jobstats"} Clear Job Stats

Accumulated job statistics can be reset by writing proc file
`job_stats`.

Clear statistics for all jobs on the local node:

    oss# lctl set_param obdfilter.*.job_stats=clear

Clear statistics only for job \'bash.0\' on lustre-MDT0000:

    mds# lctl set_param mdt.lustre-MDT0000.job_stats=bash.0

### []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="jobstats"} Configure Auto-cleanup Interval

By default, if a job is inactive for 600 seconds (10 minutes) statistics
for this job will be dropped. This expiration value can be changed
temporarily via:

    mds# lctl set_param *.*.job_cleanup_interval={max_age}

It can also be changed permanently, for example to 700 seconds via:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P mdt.testfs-*.job_cleanup_interval=700

The `job_cleanup_interval` can be set as 0 to disable the auto-cleanup.
Note that if auto-cleanup of Jobstats is disabled, then all statistics
will be kept in memory forever, which may eventually consume all memory
on the servers. In this case, any monitoring tool should explicitly
clear individual job statistics as they are processed, as shown above.

### []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="lljobstat"} Identifying Top Jobs

Since Lustre 2.15 the `lljobstat` utility can be used to monitor and
identify the top JobIDs generating load on a particular server. This
allows the administrator to quickly see which applications/users/clients
(depending on how the JobID is conigured) are generating the most
filesystem RPCs and take appropriate action if needed.

    mds# lljobstat -c 10
    ---
        timestamp: 1665984678
        top_jobs:
        - ls.500:          {ops: 64, ga: 64}
        - touch.500:       {ops: 6, op: 1, cl: 1, mn: 1, ga: 1, sa: 2}
        - bash.0:          {ops: 3, ga: 3}
        ...

It is possible to specify the number of top jobs to monitor as well as
the refresh interval, among other options.

## []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="Lustre Monitoring Tool"} Lustre Monitoring Tool (LMT) {#lmt}

The Lustre Monitoring Tool (LMT) is a Python-based, distributed system
that provides a `top`-like display of activity on server-side nodes
(MDS, OSS and portals routers) on one or more Lustre file systems. It
does not provide support for monitoring clients. For more information on
LMT, including the setup procedure, see:

[ https://github.com/chaos/lmt/wiki](https://github.com/chaos/lmt/wiki)

## `CollectL`

`CollectL` is another tool that can be used to monitor a Lustre file
system. You can run `CollectL` on a Lustre system that has any
combination of MDSs, OSTs and clients. The collected data can be written
to a file for continuous logging and played back at a later time. It can
also be converted to a format suitable for plotting.

For more information about `CollectL`, see:

[ http://collectl.sourceforge.net](http://collectl.sourceforge.net)

Lustre-specific documentation is also available. See:

[
http://collectl.sourceforge.net/Tutorial-Lustre.html](http://collectl.sourceforge.net/Tutorial-Lustre.html)

## []{.indexterm primary="monitoring" secondary="additional tools"} Other Monitoring Options {#other_monitoring_options}

A variety of standard tools are available publicly including the
following:

-   `lltop` - Lustre load monitor with batch scheduler integration.
    <https://github.com/jhammond/lltop>

-   `tacc_stats` - A job-oriented system monitor, analyzation, and
    visualization tool that probes Lustre interfaces and collects
    statistics. <https://github.com/jhammond/tacc_stats>

-   `xltop` - A continuous Lustre monitor with batch scheduler
    integration. <https://github.com/jhammond/xltop>

Another option is to script a simple monitoring solution that looks at
various reports from `ipconfig`, as well as the `procfs` files generated
by the Lustre software.
