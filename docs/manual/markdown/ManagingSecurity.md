## []{.indexterm primary="Access Control List (ACL)"} Using ACLs {#managingSecurity.acl}

An access control list (ACL), is a set of data that informs an operating
system about permissions or access rights that each user or group has to
specific system objects, such as directories or files. Each object has a
unique security attribute that identifies users who have access to it.
The ACL lists each object and user access privileges such as read, write
or execute.

### []{.indexterm primary="Access Control List (ACL)" secondary="
        how they work"}How ACLs Work {#managingSecurity.acl.howItWorks}

Implementing ACLs varies between operating systems. Systems that support
the Portable Operating System Interface (POSIX) family of standards
share a simple yet powerful file system permission model, which should
be well-known to the Linux/UNIX administrator. ACLs add finer-grained
permissions to this model, allowing for more complicated permission
schemes. For a detailed explanation of ACLs on a Linux operating system,
refer to the SUSE Labs article [ Posix Access Control Lists on
Linux](https://www.usenix.org/legacyurl/posix-access-control-lists-linux).

We have implemented ACLs according to this model. The Lustre software
works with the standard Linux ACL tools, setfacl, getfacl, and the
historical chacl, normally installed with the ACL package.

::: note
ACL support is a system-range feature, meaning that all clients have ACL
enabled or not. You cannot specify which clients should enable ACL.
:::

### []{.indexterm primary="Access Control List (ACL)" secondary="using"}Using ACLs with the Lustre Software {#managingSecurity.acl.using}

POSIX Access Control Lists (ACLs) can be used with the Lustre software.
An ACL consists of file entries representing permissions based on
standard POSIX file system object permissions that define three classes
of user (owner, group and other). Each class is associated with a set of
permissions \[read (r), write (w) and execute (x)\].

-   Owner class permissions define access privileges of the file owner.

-   Group class permissions define access privileges of the owning
    group.

-   Other class permissions define access privileges of all users not in
    the owner or group class.

The `ls -l` command displays the owner, group, and other class
permissions in the first column of its output (for example, `-rw-r- --`
for a regular file with read and write access for the owner class, read
access for the group class, and no access for others).

Minimal ACLs have three entries. Extended ACLs have more than the three
entries. Extended ACLs also contain a mask entry and may contain any
number of named user and named group entries.

To check ACLs on the MDS, check that the `acl` connect flag is listed
(default since Lustre 1.8):

    # lctl get_param -n mdc.home-MDT0000-mdc-*.connect_flags | grep acl
          

ACLs are enabled by default on a Lustre file system, and are controlled
on a system-wide basis; either all clients enable ACLs or none do.
Activating ACLs is controlled by MDS mount options `acl`/`noacl` to
enable or disable ACLs, respectively. You do not need to change the
client configuration, and the `acl` string will not appear in the client
mount options in `/etc/mtab`.

If ACLs are not enabled on the MDS, then any attempts to reference an
ACL on a client return an `Operation not supported` error.

### []{.indexterm primary="Access Control List (ACL)" secondary="examples"}Examples {#managingSecurity.acl.examples}

These examples are taken directly from the POSIX paper referenced above.
ACLs on a Lustre file system work exactly like ACLs on any Linux file
system. They are manipulated with the standard tools in the standard
manner. Below, we create a directory and allow a specific user access.

## []{.indexterm primary="root squash"}Using Root Squash {#managingSecurity.root_squash}

Root squash is a security feature which restricts super-user access
rights to a Lustre file system. Without the root squash feature enabled,
Lustre file system users on untrusted clients could access or modify
files owned by root on the file system, including deleting them. Using
the root squash feature restricts file access/modifications as the root
user. Note, however, that this does *not* prevent users from accessing
files owned by *other* users.

The root squash feature works by re-mapping the user ID (UID) and group
ID (GID) of the root user to a UID and GID specified by the system
administrator. The preferred way to configure root squash is via
nodemaps and the `admin` property. Nodemaps allow root squash on a
per-client basis. With UID maps, the clients can even have a local root
UID without actually having root access to the filesystem itself.

Please refer to explanations about the `admin` property in the chapter
dedicated to Nodemaps, in
[???](#lustrenodemap.alteringproperties.managing).

## []{.indexterm primary="Isolation"} Isolating Clients to a Sub-directory Tree {#managingSecurity.isolation}

Namespace isolation is the Lustre implementation of the generic concept
of multi-tenancy, which aims at providing separated namespaces from a
single filesystem. Lustre namespace isolation enables different
populations of users on the same file system beyond normal Unix
permissions/ACLs, even when users on the clients may have root access.
Those tenants share the same file system, but they are isolated from
each other, i.e., they cannot access or even see each other\'s files,
and they are not aware that they are sharing common file system
resources.

Lustre namespace isolation leverages the Fileset feature
([???](#SystemConfigurationUtilities.fileset)) to restrict clients to
subdirectories of the filesystem rather than the root directory. To
achieve namespace isolation, the subdirectory mount, which presents to
tenants only their own fileset, has to be imposed to the clients. To
that extent, we make use of the nodemap feature
([???](#lustrenodemap.title)). We group all clients used by a tenant
under a common nodemap entry, and we assign to this nodemap entry the
fileset to which the tenant is restricted.

### []{.indexterm primary="Isolation" secondary="
        client identification"}Identifying Clients {#managingSecurity.isolation.clientid}

Enforcing multi-tenancy on Lustre relies on the ability to properly
identify the client nodes used by a tenant, and trust those identities.
This can be achieved by having physical hardware and/or network
security, so that client nodes have well-known NIDs. It is also possible
to make use of strong authentication with Kerberos or Shared-Secret Key
(see [???](#lustressk)). Kerberos prevents NID spoofing, as every client
needs its own credentials, based on its NID, in order to connect to the
servers. Shared-Secret Key also prevents tenant impersonation, because
keys can be linked to a specific nodemap. See [???](#ssknodemaprole) for
detailed explanations.

### []{.indexterm primary="Isolation" secondary="
        configuring"}Configuring Namespace Isolation {#managingSecurity.isolation.configuring}

Namespace isolation on Lustre can be achieved by setting one `fileset`
property (or multiple filesets with Lustre 2.17 or later) on a nodemap
entry. All clients belonging to this nodemap entry will automatically
mount this (primary) fileset instead of the root directory. For example:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_set_fileset --name tenant1 --fileset '/dir1'

So all clients matching the `tenant1` nodemap are presented the fileset
`/dir1` when mounting. This means these clients are doing an implicit
subdirectory mount on the subdirectory `/dir1`.

::: note
If subdirectory defined as fileset does not exist on the filesystem, it
will prevent any client belonging to the nodemap from mounting Lustre.
:::

To delete the fileset parameter, just set it to an empty string:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_set_fileset --name tenant1 --fileset ''

Using `lctl nodemap_set_fileset` automatically distributes the fileset
to all servers and makes isolation permanent. **As of Lustre 2.18**,
`lctl nodemap_set_fileset` is deprecated in favor of
`lctl nodemap_fileset_{add,del,modify}`. Note that
`lctl nodemap_set_fileset` can only set the primary fileset and cannot
set it as read-only.

::: note
**Before Lustre 2.17**, making isolation permanent requires running
`lctl set_param -P` on the MGS node:

    mgs# lctl set_param nodemap.tenant1.fileset=/dir1
    mgs# lctl set_param -P nodemap.tenant1.fileset=/dir1

This stores the fileset parameter in the Lustre config logs, allowing
the servers to retrieve this information after a restart. **As of Lustre
2.17**, this command is deprecated and discouraged and only
`lctl nodemap_set_fileset` should be used.
:::

### []{.indexterm primary="Isolation" secondary="
        multifilesets"}Multiple Filesets {#managingSecurity.isolation.multifilesets}

Previously, nodemaps supported a single fileset per nodemap. As of
Lustre 2.17, it is possible to define multiple filesets per nodemap. The
previous single fileset is called a *primary* fileset, offering similar
behavior and acting as the default subdirectory when clients (associated
with the nodemap) mount the filesystem. Additional *alternate* filesets
can be defined, which offer improved flexibility and allow clients to
mount additional subdirectories of the filesystem.

Each nodemap supports a single primary fileset and up to 255 alternate
filesets. It is possible to only define alternate filesets without a
primary fileset. In this case, any subdirectory must be explicitly set
at client mount time. Therefore, alternate filesets never enforce a
default subdirectory mountpoint for clients. Each fileset can further be
set as *read-only*, preventing clients from mounting the subdirectory
with write access, i.e., the clients implicitly mount the filesystem in
`mode=ro` if the read-only fileset applies to the current mount
subdirectory.

Similar to other nodemap commands, multiple fileset commands must be run
on the MGS. The nodemap configuration is then asychonously propagated to
the other server targets and persisted.

#### Managing Multiple Filesets {#managingSecurity.isolation.multifilesets.configuration}

The following commands are used to manage multiple filesets on a
nodemap. Please refer to the respective man page of each command for
more details and examples. A fileset is added to the nodemap with the
`lctl nodemap_fileset_add` command:

    lctl nodemap_fileset_add --name NODEMAP_NAME --fileset SUBDIRECTORY [--alt] [--ro]

-   `--name` specifies the nodemap that this fileset should be
    associated with (mandatory).

-   `--fileset` specifies the subdirectory to restrict the clients to.
    The fileset must begin with \'/\' (mandatory).

-   `--alt` specifies that the fileset is an alternate fileset. If not
    specified, the fileset is the primary fileset. Multiple primary
    filesets and duplicate fileset definitions across fileset types are
    not allowed.

-   `--ro` specifies that the fileset is read-only. If not specified,
    the fileset is read-write.

A fileset is deleted from the nodemap with the
`lctl nodemap_fileset_del` command:

    lctl nodemap_fileset_del --name NODEMAP_NAME [--all] [--fileset SUBDIRECTORY]

-   `--name` specifies the nodemap that one or all fileset should be
    deleted from (mandatory).

-   `--all` specifies that all filesets should be deleted from the
    nodemap. This option cannot be used with `--fileset`.

-   `--fileset` specifies the fileset to delete from the nodemap. This
    option cannot be used with `--all`. Either `--all` or `--fileset`
    must be specified.

Filesets can be updated in-place with the `lctl nodemap_fileset_modify`
command:

    lctl nodemap_fileset_modify --name NODEMAP_NAME --fileset SUBDIRECTORY \
      [--rename|-r NEW_SUBDIRECTORY] [--primary|-p] [--alt|-a] [--rw] [--ro]

-   `--name` specifies the nodemap containing the fileset to modify
    (mandatory).

-   `--fileset` specifies the path of the fileset to modify (mandatory).

-   `--rename` changes the fileset\'s path to the specified new
    subdirectory. The new path must begin with a slash (\'`/`\') and
    cannot yet exist as a fileset of that type on the same nodemap.

-   `--primary` converts the fileset to a primary fileset. The flag has
    no effect if the fileset is already primary. Note that `--primary`
    can only convert an alternate fileset to primary if there is
    currently no primary fileset set on the nodemap. This option cannot
    be used with `--alt`.

-   `--alt` converts the fileset to an alternate fileset. The flag has
    no effect if the fileset is already alternate. This option cannot be
    used with `--primary`.

-   `--rw` sets the fileset to read-write access mode. The flag has no
    effect if the fileset is already set to read-write. This option
    cannot be used with `--ro`.

-   `--ro` sets the fileset to read-only access mode. The flag has no
    effect if the fileset is already set to read-only. This option
    cannot be used with `--rw`.

#### How Multiple Filesets affect Client Mounting {#managingSecurity.isolation.multifilesets.mounting}

Filesets can be used to provide namespace isolation within the Lustre
filesystem by explicitly restricting clients of a nodemap to specific
subdirectories when mounting the client. The restriction depends on
whether the fileset is designated as primary, alternate, or read-only.
On mounting the Lustre client, the following rules apply:

1.  If the nodemap is inactive or no filesets are defined, no
    subdirectory restrictions are applied.

2.  If the primary fileset is set and no subdirectory is presented when
    mounting the Lustre client, the primary fileset\'s subdirectory is
    used as the filesystem root directory.

3.  If any defined fileset (primary or alternate) matches the presented
    mounted subdirectory exactly or as a prefix, the subdirectory mount
    is used as the filesystem root directory.

4.  If the fileset matches in 3, the presented mounting subdirectory is
    appended to the fileset\'s subdirectory.

If alternate filesets are defined but no primary fileset is set, only 3
applies.

## []{.indexterm primary="selinux policy check"} Checking SELinux Policy Enforced by Lustre Clients {#managingSecurity.sepol}

SELinux provides a mechanism in Linux for supporting Mandatory Access
Control (MAC) policies. When a MAC policy is enforced, the operating
system\'s (OS) kernel defines application rights, firewalling
applications from compromising the entire system. Regular users do not
have the ability to override the policy.

One purpose of SELinux is to protect the **OS** from privilege
escalation. To that extent, SELinux defines confined and unconfined
domains for processes and users. Each process, user, file is assigned a
security context, and rules define the allowed operations by processes
and users on files.

Another purpose of SELinux can be to protect **data** sensitivity,
thanks to Multi-Level Security (MLS). MLS works on top of SELinux, by
defining the concept of security levels in addition to domains. Each
process, user and file is assigned a security level, and the model
states that processes and users can read the same or lower security
level, but can only write to their own or higher security level.

From a file system perspective, the security context of files must be
stored permanently. Lustre makes use of the `security.selinux` extended
attributes on files to hold this information. Lustre supports SELinux on
the client side. All you have to do to have MAC and MLS on Lustre is to
enforce the appropriate SELinux policy (as provided by the Linux
distribution) on all Lustre clients. No SELinux is required on Lustre
servers.

Because Lustre is a distributed file system, the specificity when using
MLS is that Lustre really needs to make sure data is always accessed by
nodes with the SELinux MLS policy properly enforced. Otherwise, data is
not protected. This means Lustre has to check that SELinux is properly
enforced on client side, with the right, unaltered policy. And if
SELinux is not enforced as expected on a client, the server denies its
access to Lustre.

### []{.indexterm primary="selinux policy check" secondary="
        determining"}Determining SELinux Policy Info {#managingSecurity.sepol.determining}

A string that represents the SELinux Status info will be used by servers
as a reference, to check if clients are enforcing SELinux properly. This
reference string can be obtained on a client node known to enforce the
right SELinux policy, by calling the `l_getsepol` command line utility:

    client# l_getsepol
    SELinux status info: 1:mls:31:40afb76d077c441b69af58cccaaa2ca63641ed6e21b0a887dc21a684f508b78f

The string describing the SELinux policy has the following syntax:

`mode:name:version:hash`

where:

-   `mode` is a digit telling if SELinux is in Permissive mode (0) or
    Enforcing mode (1)

-   `name` is the name of the SELinux policy

-   `version` is the version of the SELinux policy

-   `hash` is the computed hash of the binary representation of the
    policy, as exported in /etc/selinux/`name`/policy/policy. `version`

### []{.indexterm primary="selinux policy check" secondary="
        enforcing"}Enforcing SELinux Policy Check {#managingSecurity.sepol.configuring}

SELinux policy check can be enforced by setting the `sepol` parameter on
a nodemap entry. All clients belonging to this nodemap entry must
enforce the SELinux policy described by this parameter, otherwise they
are denied access to the Lustre file system. For example:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_set_sepol --name restricted
         --sepol '1:mls:31:40afb76d077c441b69af58cccaaa2ca63641ed6e21b0a887dc21a684f508b78f'

So all clients matching the `restricted` nodemap must enforce the
SELinux policy which description matches
`1:mls:31:40afb76d077c441b69af58cccaaa2ca63641ed6e21b0a887dc21a684f508b78f`.
If not, they will get Permission Denied when trying to mount or access
files on the Lustre file system.

To delete the `sepol` parameter, just set it to an empty string:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_set_sepol --name restricted --sepol ''

See [???](#lustrenodemap.title) for more details about the Nodemap
feature.

### []{.indexterm primary="selinux policy check" secondary="
        making permanent"}Making SELinux Policy Check Permanent {#managingSecurity.sepol.permanent}

In order to make SELinux Policy check permanent, the sepol parameter on
the nodemap has to be set with `lctl set_param` with the `-P` option.

    mgs# lctl set_param nodemap.restricted.sepol=1:mls:31:40afb76d077c441b69af58cccaaa2ca63641ed6e21b0a887dc21a684f508b78f
    mgs# lctl set_param -P nodemap.restricted.sepol=1:mls:31:40afb76d077c441b69af58cccaaa2ca63641ed6e21b0a887dc21a684f508b78f

This way the sepol parameter will be stored in the Lustre config logs,
letting the servers retrieve the information after a restart.

### []{.indexterm primary="selinux policy check" secondary="
        sending client"}Sending SELinux Status Info from Clients {#managingSecurity.sepol.client}

In order for Lustre clients to send their SELinux status information, in
case SELinux is enabled locally, the `send_sepol` ptlrpc kernel
module\'s parameter has to be set to a non-zero value. `send_sepol`
accepts various values:

-   0: do not send SELinux policy info;

-   -1: fetch SELinux policy info for every request;

-   N \> 0: only fetch SELinux policy info every N seconds. Use
    `N = 2^31-1` to have SELinux policy info fetched only at mount time.

Clients that are part of a nodemap on which `sepol` is defined must send
SELinux status info. And the SELinux policy they enforce must match the
representation stored into the nodemap. Otherwise they will be denied
access to the Lustre file system.

## []{.indexterm primary="Client-side encryption"} Encrypting files and directories {#managingSecurity.clientencryption}

The purpose that client-side encryption wants to serve is to be able to
provide a special directory for each user, to safely store sensitive
files. The goals are to protect data in transit between clients and
servers, and protect data at rest.

This feature is implemented directly at the Lustre client level. Lustre
client-side encryption relies on kernel `fscrypt`. `fscrypt` is a
library which filesystems can hook into to support transparent
encryption of files and directories. As a consequence, the key points
described below are extracted from `fscrypt` documentation.

For full details, please refer to documentation available with the
Lustre sources, under the `Documentation/client_side_encryption`
directory.

::: note
The client-side encryption feature is available natively on Lustre
clients running a Linux distribution with at least kernel 5.4. It is
also available thanks to an additional kernel library provided by
Lustre, on clients that run a Linux distribution with basic support for
encryption, including:

-   CentOS/RHEL 8.1 and later;

-   Ubuntu 18.04 and later;

-   SLES 15 SP2 and later.
:::

### []{.indexterm primary="encryption access semantics"}Client-side encryption access semantics {#managingSecurity.clientencryption.semantics}

Only Lustre clients need access to encryption master keys. Keys are
added to the filesystem-level encryption keyring on the Lustre client.

-   **With the key**

    With the encryption key, encrypted regular files, directories, and
    symlinks behave very similarly to their unencrypted counterparts
    \-\-- after all, the encryption is intended to be transparent.
    However, astute users may notice some differences in behavior:

    -   Unencrypted files, or files encrypted with a different
        encryption policy (i.e. different key, modes, or flags), cannot
        be renamed or linked into an encrypted directory. However,
        encrypted files can be renamed within an encrypted directory, or
        into an unencrypted directory.

        ::: note
        \"moving\" an unencrypted file into an encrypted directory, e.g.
        with the `mv` program, is implemented in userspace by a copy
        followed by a delete. Be aware the original unencrypted data may
        remain recoverable from free space on the disk; it is best to
        keep all files encrypted from the very beginning.
        :::

    -   On Lustre, Direct I/O is supported for encrypted files.

    -   The `fallocate()` operations `FALLOC_FL_COLLAPSE_RANGE`,
        `FALLOC_FL_INSERT_RANGE`, and `FALLOC_FL_ZERO_RANGE` are not
        supported on encrypted files and will fail with `EOPNOTSUPP`.

    -   DAX (Direct Access) is not supported on encrypted files.

    -   The st_size of an encrypted symlink will not necessarily give
        the length of the symlink target as required by POSIX. It will
        actually give the length of the ciphertext, which will be
        slightly longer than the plaintext due to NUL-padding and an
        extra 2-byte overhead.

    -   The maximum length of an encrypted symlink is 2 bytes shorter
        than the maximum length of an unencrypted symlink.

    -   `mmap` is supported. This is possible because the pagecache for
        an encrypted file contains the plaintext, not the ciphertext.

-   **Without the key**

    Some filesystem operations may be performed on encrypted regular
    files, directories, and symlinks even before their encryption key
    has been added, or after their encryption key has been removed:

    -   File metadata may be read, e.g. using `stat()`.

    -   Directories may be listed, in which case the filenames will be
        listed in an encoded form derived from their ciphertext. The
        algorithm is subject to change but it is guaranteed that the
        presented filenames will be no longer than NAME_MAX bytes, will
        not contain the `/` or `\0` characters, and will uniquely
        identify directory entries. The `.` and `..` directory entries
        are special. They are always present and are not encrypted or
        encoded.

    -   Files may be deleted. That is, nondirectory files may be deleted
        with `unlink()` as usual, and empty directories may be deleted
        with `rmdir()` as usual. Therefore, `rm` and `rm -r` will work
        as expected.

    -   Symlink targets may be read and followed, but they will be
        presented in encrypted form, similar to filenames in
        directories. Hence, they are unlikely to point to anywhere
        useful.

    Without the key, regular files cannot be opened or truncated.
    Attempts to do so will fail with `ENOKEY`. This implies that any
    regular file operations that require a file descriptor, such as
    `read()`, `write()`, `mmap()`, `fallocate()`, and `ioctl()`, are
    also forbidden.

    Also without the key, files of any type (including directories)
    cannot be created or linked into an encrypted directory, nor can a
    name in an encrypted directory be the source or target of a rename,
    nor can an `O_TMPFILE` temporary file be created in an encrypted
    directory. All such operations will fail with `ENOKEY`.

    It is not currently possible to backup and restore encrypted files
    without the encryption key. This would require special APIs which
    have not yet been implemented.

-   **Encryption policy enforcement**

    After an encryption policy has been set on a directory, all regular
    files, directories, and symbolic links created in that directory
    (recursively) will inherit that encryption policy. Special files
    \-\-- that is, named pipes, device nodes, and UNIX domain sockets
    \-\-- will not be encrypted.

    Except for those special files, it is forbidden to have unencrypted
    files, or files encrypted with a different encryption policy, in an
    encrypted directory tree.

### []{.indexterm primary="encryption key hierarchy"}Client-side encryption key hierarchy {#managingSecurity.clientencryption.keyhierarchy}

Each encrypted directory tree is protected by a master key.

To \"unlock\" an encrypted directory tree, userspace must provide the
appropriate master key. There can be any number of master keys, each of
which protects any number of directory trees on any number of
filesystems.

### []{.indexterm primary="encryption modes usage"}Client-side encryption modes and usage {#managingSecurity.clientencryption.modes}

`fscrypt` allows one encryption mode to be specified for file contents
and one encryption mode to be specified for filenames. Different
directory trees are permitted to use different encryption modes.
Currently, the following pairs of encryption modes are supported:

-   AES-256-XTS for contents and AES-256-CTS-CBC for filenames

-   AES-128-CBC for contents and AES-128-CTS-CBC for filenames

If unsure, you should use the (AES-256-XTS, AES-256-CTS-CBC) pair.

::: warning
In Lustre 2.14, client-side encryption only supports content encryption,
and not filename encryption. As a consequence, only content encryption
mode will be taken into account, and filename encryption mode will be
ignored to leave filenames in clear text.
:::

::: warning
When Lustre client is built against the embedded kernel library instead
of the in-kernel fscrypt, the ability to encrypt file and directory
names is governed by new llite parameter named
`enable_filename_encryption`, introduced in 2.15, and set to 0 by
default. When this parameter is 0, new empty directories configured as
encrypted use content encryption only, and not name encryption. This
mode is inherited for all subdirectories and files. When
`enable_filename_encryption` parameter is set to 1, new empty
directories configured as encrypted use full encryption capabilities by
encrypting file content and also file and directory names. This mode is
inherited for all subdirectories and files. To set the
`enable_filename_encryption` parameter globally for all clients, one can
do on the MGS:

    mgs# lctl set_param -P llite.*.enable_filename_encryption=1

Be aware that the `enable_filename_encryption` tuning parameter is not
available when Lustre client is built against in-kernel fscrypt. Indeed,
the in-kernel fscrypt library always encrypts file name along with file
content.

Also note that new files and directories under a parent encrypted
directory created with Lustre 2.14 will not have their names encrypted.
Also, because files created with Lustre 2.14 did not have their names
encrypted, they will remain so after upgrade to 2.15. To benefit from
name encryption for an old directory previously created with Lustre
2.14, you need to do the following after upgrade to 2.15 is complete:

1.  create a new encrypted directory. This can use an already existing
    protector.

2.  unlock the old encrypted directory.

3.  copy all files and directories recursively from the old encrypted
    directory to the newly created encrypted directory. Note that this
    operation will re-encrypt all files contents in addition to names.

4.  remove the old encrypted directory.

### []{.indexterm primary="encryption threat model"}Client-side encryption threat model {#managingSecurity.clientencryption.threatmodel}

-   **Offline attacks**

    For the Lustre case, block devices are Lustre targets attached to
    the Lustre servers. Manipulating the filesystem offline means
    accessing the filesystem on these targets while Lustre is offline.

    Provided that a strong encryption key is chosen, `fscrypt` protects
    the confidentiality of file contents in the event of a single
    point-in-time permanent offline compromise of the block device
    content. Lustre client-side encryption does not protect the
    confidentiality of metadata, e.g. file names, file sizes, file
    permissions, file timestamps, and extended attributes. Also, the
    existence and location of holes (unallocated blocks which logically
    contain all zeroes) in files is not protected.

-   **Online attacks**

    -   On Lustre client

        After an encryption key has been added, `fscrypt` does not hide
        the plaintext file contents or filenames from other users on the
        same node. Instead, existing access control mechanisms such as
        file mode bits, POSIX ACLs, LSMs, or namespaces should be used
        for this purpose.

        For the Lustre case, it means plaintext file contents or
        filenames are not hidden from other users on the same Lustre
        client.

        An attacker who compromises the system enough to read from
        arbitrary memory, e.g. by exploiting a kernel security
        vulnerability, can compromise all encryption keys that are
        currently in use. However, `fscrypt` allows encryption keys to
        be removed from the kernel, which may protect them from later
        compromise. Key removal can be carried out by non-root users. In
        more detail, the key removal will wipe the master encryption key
        from kernel memory. Moreover, it will try to evict all cached
        inodes which had been \"unlocked\" using the key, thereby wiping
        their per-file keys and making them once again appear
        \"locked\", i.e. in ciphertext or encrypted form.

    -   On Lustre server

        An attacker on a Lustre server who compromises the system enough
        to read arbitrary memory, e.g. by exploiting a kernel security
        vulnerability, cannot compromise Lustre files content. Indeed,
        encryption keys are not forwarded to the Lustre servers, and
        servers do not carry out decryption or encryption. Moreover,
        bulk RPCs received by servers contain encrypted data, which is
        written as-is to the underlying filesystem.

### []{.indexterm primary="encryption fscrypt policy"}Manage encryption on directories {#managingSecurity.clientencryption.fscrypt}

By default, Lustre client-side encryption is enabled, letting users
define encryption policies on a per-directory basis.

::: note
Administrators can decide to prevent a Lustre client mount-point from
using encryption by specifying the `noencrypt` client mount option. This
can be also enforced from server side thanks to the `forbid_encryption`
property on nodemaps. See [???](#alteringproperties) for how to manage
nodemaps.
:::

`fscrypt` userspace tool can be used to manage encryption policies. See
https://github.com/google/fscrypt for comprehensive explanations. Below
are examples on how to use this tool with Lustre. If not told otherwise,
commands must be run on Lustre client side.

-   Two preliminary steps are required before actually deciding which
    directories to encrypt, and this is the only functionality which
    requires root privileges. Administrator has to run:

        # fscrypt setup
        Customizing passphrase hashing difficulty for this system...
        Created global config file at "/etc/fscrypt.conf".
        Metadata directories created at "/.fscrypt".

    This first command has to be run on all clients that want to use
    encryption, as it sets up global fscrypt parameters outside of
    Lustre.

        # fscrypt setup /mnt/lustre
        Metadata directories created at "/mnt/lustre/.fscrypt"

    This second command has to be run on just one Lustre client.

    ::: note
    The file `/etc/fscrypt.conf` can be edited. It is strongly
    recommended to set `policy_version` to 2, so that `fscrypt` wipes
    files from memory when the encryption key is removed.
    :::

-   Now a regular user is able to select a directory to encrypt:

        $ fscrypt encrypt /mnt/lustre/vault
        The following protector sources are available:
        1 - Your login passphrase (pam_passphrase)
        2 - A custom passphrase (custom_passphrase)
        3 - A raw 256-bit key (raw_key)
        Enter the source number for the new protector [2 - custom_passphrase]: 2
        Enter a name for the new protector: shield
        Enter custom passphrase for protector "shield":
        Confirm passphrase:
        "/mnt/lustre/vault" is now encrypted, unlocked, and ready for use.

    Starting from here, all files and directories created under
    `/mnt/lustre/vault` will be encrypted, according to the policy
    defined at the previsous step.

    ::: note
    The encryption policy is inherited by all subdirectories. It is not
    possible to change the policy for a subdirectory.
    :::

-   Another user can decide to encrypt a different directory with its
    own protector:

        $ fscrypt encrypt /mnt/lustre/private
        Should we create a new protector? [y/N] Y
        The following protector sources are available:
        1 - Your login passphrase (pam_passphrase)
        2 - A custom passphrase (custom_passphrase)
        3 - A raw 256-bit key (raw_key)
        Enter the source number for the new protector [2 - custom_passphrase]: 2
        Enter a name for the new protector: armor
        Enter custom passphrase for protector "armor":
        Confirm passphrase:
        "/mnt/lustre/private" is now encrypted, unlocked, and ready for use.

-   Users can decide to lock an encrypted directory at any time:

        $ fscrypt lock /mnt/lustre/vault
        "/mnt/lustre/vault" is now locked.

    This action prevents access to encrypted content, and by removing
    the key from memory, it also wipes files from memory if they are not
    still open.

-   Users regain access to the encrypted directory with the command:

        $ fscrypt unlock /mnt/lustre/vault
        Enter custom passphrase for protector "shield":
        "/mnt/lustre/vault" is now unlocked and ready for use.

-   Actually, `fscrypt` does not give direct access to master keys, but
    to protectors that are used to encrypt them. This mechanism gives
    the ability to change a passphrase:

        $ fscrypt status /mnt/lustre
        lustre filesystem "/mnt/lustre" has 2 protectors and 2 policies

        PROTECTOR         LINKED  DESCRIPTION

        Enter new custom passphrase for protector "shield":
        Confirm passphrase:
        Passphrase for protector deacab807bf0e788 successfully changed.

    It makes also possible to have multiple protectors for the same
    policy. This is really useful when several users share an encrypted
    directory, because it avoids the need to share any secret between
    them.

## []{.indexterm primary="Kerberos"} Configuring Kerberos (KRB) Security {#managingSecurity.kerberos}

This chapter describes how to use Kerberos with Lustre.

### What Is Kerberos? {#managingSecurity.kerberos.whatisit}

Kerberos is a mechanism for authenticating all entities (such as users
and servers) on an \"unsafe\" network. Each of these entities, known as
\"principals\", negotiate a runtime key with the Kerberos server. This
key enables principals to verify that messages from the Kerberos server
are authentic. By trusting the Kerberos server, users and services can
authenticate one another.

Setting up Lustre with Kerberos can provide advanced security
protections for the Lustre network. Broadly, Kerberos offers three types
of benefit:

-   Allows Lustre connection peers (MDS, OSS and clients) to
    authenticate one another.

-   Protects the integrity of PTLRPC messages from being modified during
    network transfer.

-   Protects the privacy of the PTLRPC message from being eavesdropped
    during network transfer.

Kerberos uses the \"kernel keyring\" client upcall mechanism.

### Security Flavor {#managingSecurity.kerberos.securityflavor}

A security flavor is a string to describe what kind authentication and
data transformation be performed upon a PTLRPC connection. It covers
both RPC message and BULK data.

The supported flavors are described in following table:

  Base Flavor   Authentication   RPC Message Protection     Bulk Data Protection   Notes
  ------------- ---------------- -------------------------- ---------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ***null***    N/A              N/A                        N/A                    
  ***krb5n***   GSS/Kerberos5    null                       checksum               No protection of RPC message, checksum protection of bulk data, light performance overhead.
  ***krb5a***   GSS/Kerberos5    partial integrity (krb5)   checksum               Only header of RPC message is integrity protected, and checksum protection of bulk data, more performance overhead compare to krb5n.
  ***krb5i***   GSS/Kerberos5    integrity (krb5)           integrity (krb5)       transformation algorithm is determined by actual Kerberos algorithms enforced by KDC and principals; heavy performance penalty.
  ***krb5p***   GSS/Kerberos5    privacy (krb5)             privacy (krb5)         transformation privacy protection algorithm is determined by actual Kerberos algorithms enforced by KDC and principals; the heaviest performance penalty.

### Kerberos Setup {#managingSecurity.kerberos.kerberossetup}

#### Distribution {#managingSecurity.kerberos.kerberossetup.distribution}

We only support MIT Kerberos 5, from version 1.3.

For environmental requirements in general, and clock synchronization in
particular, please refer to section [???](#section_rh2_d4w_gk).

#### Principals Configuration {#managingSecurity.kerberos.kerberossetup.configuration}

-   Configure client nodes:

    -   For each client node, create a `lustre_root` principal and
        generate keytab.

            kadmin> addprinc -randkey lustre_root/client_host.domain@REALM

            kadmin> ktadd lustre_root/client_host.domain@REALM

    -   Install the keytab on the client node.

-   Configure MGS nodes:

    -   For each MGS node, create a `lustre_mgs` principal and generate
        keytab.

            kadmin> addprinc -randkey lustre_mgs/mgs_host.domain@REALM

            kadmin> ktadd lustre_mds/mgs_host.domain@REALM

    -   Install the keytab on the MGS nodes.

-   Configure MDS nodes:

    -   For each MDS node, create a `lustre_mds` principal and generate
        keytab.

            kadmin> addprinc -randkey lustre_mds/mds_host.domain@REALM

            kadmin> ktadd lustre_mds/mds_host.domain@REALM

    -   Install the keytab on the MDS nodes.

-   Configure OSS nodes:

    -   For each OSS node, create a `lustre_oss` principal and generate
        keytab.

            kadmin> addprinc -randkey lustre_oss/oss_host.domain@REALM

            kadmin> ktadd lustre_oss/oss_host.domain@REALM

    -   Install the keytab on the client node.

::: note
-   The *host.domain* should be the FQDN in your network, otherwise
    server might not recognize any GSS request.

-   As an alternative for the client keytab, if you want to save the
    trouble of assigning unique keytab for each client node, you can
    create a general lustre_root principal and its keytab, and install
    the same keytab on as many client nodes as you want. **Be aware that
    in this way one compromised client means all clients are insecure**.

        kadmin> addprinc -randkey lustre_root@REALM

        kadmin> ktadd lustre_root@REALM

-   Lustre support following *enctypes* for MIT Kerberos 5 version 1.3
    or higher:

    -   *aes128-cts*

    -   *aes256-cts*
:::

### Networking {#managingSecurity.kerberos.network}

On networks for which name resolution to IP address is possible, like
TCP or InfiniBand, the names used in the principals must be the ones
that resolve to the IP addresses used by the Lustre NIDs.

If you are using a network which is **NOT** TCP or InfiniBand (e.g.
PTL4LND), you need to have a `/etc/lustre/nid2hostname` script on
**each** node, which purpose is to translate NID into hostname.
Following is a possible example for PTL4LND:

    #!/bin/bash
    set -x

    # convert a NID for a LND to a hostname

    # called with thre arguments: lnd netid nid
    #   $lnd is the string "PTL4LND", etc.
    #   $netid is the network identifier in hex string format
    #   $nid is the NID in hex format
    # output the corresponding hostname,
    # or error message leaded by a '@' for error logging.

    lnd=$1
    netid=$2
    # convert hex NID number to decimal
    nid=$((0x$3))

    case $lnd in
        PTL4LND)   # simply add 'node' at the beginning
            echo "node$nid"
            ;;
        *)
        echo "@unknown LND: $lnd"
            ;;
    esac

### Required packages {#managingSecurity.kerberos.requiredpackages}

Every node should have following packages installed:

-   krb5-workstation

-   krb5-libs

-   keyutils

-   keyutils-libs

On the node used to build Lustre with GSS support, following packages
should be installed:

-   krb5-devel

-   keyutils-libs-devel

### Build Lustre {#managingSecurity.kerberos.buildlustre}

Enable GSS at configuration time:

    ./configure --enable-gss --other-options

### Running {#managingSecurity.kerberos.running}

#### GSS Daemons {#managingSecurity.kerberos.running.gssdaemons}

Make sure to start the daemon process `lsvcgssd` on each server node
(MGS, MDS and OSS) before starting Lustre. The command syntax is:

    lsvcgssd [-f] [-v] [-g] [-m] [-o] -k

-   -f: run in foreground, instead of as daemon

-   -v: increase verbosity by 1. For example, to set the verbose level
    to 3, run \'lsvcgssd -vvv\'. Verbose logging can help you make sure
    Kerberos is set up correctly.

-   -g: service MGS

-   -m: service MDS

-   -o: service OSS

-   -k: enable kerberos support

#### Setting Security Flavors {#managingSecurity.kerberos.running.settingsecurityflavors}

Security flavors can be set by defining sptlrpc rules on the MGS. These
rules are persistent, and are in the form: `<spec>=<flavor>`

-   To add a rule:

        mgs> lctl conf_param <spec>=<flavor>

    If there is an existing rule on \<spec\>, it will be overwritten.

-   To delete a rule:

        mgs> lctl conf_param -d <spec>

-   To list existing rules:

        msg> lctl get_param mgs.MGS.live.<fs-name> | grep "srpc.flavor"

::: note
-   If nothing is specified, by default all RPC connections will use
    `null` flavor, which means no security.

-   After you change a rule, it usually takes a few minutes to apply the
    new rule to all nodes, depending on global system load.

-   Before you change a rule, make sure affected nodes are ready for the
    new security flavor. E.g. if you change flavor from `null` to
    `krb5p` but GSS/Kerberos environment is not properly configured on
    affected nodes, those nodes might be evicted because they cannot
    communicate with each other.
:::

#### Rules Syntax & Examples {#managingSecurity.kerberos.running.rulessyntaxexamples}

The general syntax is:
`<target>.srpc.flavor.<network>[.<direction>]=flavor`

-   `<target>` can be filesystem name, or specific MDT/OST device name.
    For example `testfs`, `testfs-MDT0000`, `testfs-OST0001`.

-   `<network>` is the LNet network name, for example `tcp0`, `o2ib0`,
    or `default` to not filter on LNet network.

-   `<direction>` can be one of *cli2mdt*, *cli2ost*, *mdt2mdt*,
    *mdt2ost*. Direction is optional.

Examples:

-   Apply `krb5i` on **ALL** connections for file system `testfs`:

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.default=krb5i

-   Nodes in network `tcp0` use `krb5p`; all other nodes use `null`.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.tcp0=krb5p
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.default=null

-   Nodes in network `tcp0` use `krb5p`; nodes in `o2ib0` use `krb5n`;
    among other nodes, clients use `krb5i` to MDT/OST, MDTs use `null`
    to other MDTs, MDTs use `krb5a` to OSTs.

```{=html}
<!-- -->
```
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.tcp0=krb5p
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.o2ib0=krb5n
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.default.cli2mdt=krb5i
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.default.cli2ost=krb5i
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.default.mdt2mdt=null
    mgs> lctl conf_param testfs.srpc.flavor.default.mdt2ost=krb5a

#### Regular Users Authentication {#managingSecurity.kerberos.running.authenticatenormalusers}

On client nodes, non-root users need to issue `kinit` before accessing
Lustre, just like other Kerberized applications.

-   Required by kerberos, the user\'s principal (`username@REALM`)
    should be added to the KDC.

-   Client and MDT nodes should have the same user database used for
    name and uid/gid translation.

Regular users can destroy the established security contexts before
logging out, by issuing:

    lfs flushctx -k -r <mount point>

Here `-k` is to destroy the on-disk Kerberos credential cache, similar
to `kdestroy`, and `-r` is to reap the revoked keys from the keyring
when flushing the GSS context. Otherwise it only destroys established
contexts in kernel memory.

### Secure MGS connection {#managingSecurity.kerberos.securemgsconnection}

Each node can specify which flavor to use to connect to the MGS, by
using the `mgssec=flavor` mount option. Once a flavor is chosen, it
cannot be changed until re-mount.

Because a Lustre node only has one connection to the MGS, if there is
more than one target or client on the node, they necessarily use the
same security flavor to the MGS, being the one enforced when the first
connection to the MGS was established.

By default, the MGS accepts RPCs with any flavor. But it is possible to
configure the MGS to only accept a given flavor. The syntax is identical
to what is explained in paragraph [Rules Syntax &
Examples](#managingSecurity.kerberos.running.rulessyntaxexamples), but
with special target `_mgs`:

    mgs> lctl conf_param _mgs.srpc.flavor.<network>=<flavor>
