# Mapping UIDs and GIDs with Nodemap {#lustrenodemap}

This chapter describes how to map UID and GIDs across a Lustre file
system using the nodemap feature, and includes the following sections:

-   [Setting a Mapping](#settingamapping)

-   [Removing Nodemaps](#nodemapdel)

-   [Altering Properties](#alteringproperties)

-   [Enabling the Feature](#enablingthefeature)

-   [ Nodemap](#defaultNodemap)

-   [Verifying Settings](#verifyingsettings)

-   [Ensuring Consistency](#ensuringconsistency)

## Setting a Mapping {#settingamapping}

The nodemap feature allows UIDs and GIDs from remote systems to be
mapped to local sets of UIDs and GIDs while retaining POSIX ownership,
permissions and quota information. As a result, multiple sites with
conflicting user and group identifiers can operate on a single Lustre
file system without creating collisions in UID or GID space.

### Defining Terms

When the nodemap feature is enabled, client file system access to a
Lustre system is filtered through the nodemap identity mapping policy
engine. Lustre connectivity is governed by network identifiers, or
*NIDs*, such as `192.168.7.121@tcp`. When an operation is made from a
NID, Lustre decides if that NID is part of a *nodemap*, a policy group
consisting of one or more NID ranges. If no policy group exists for that
NID, access is squashed to user `nobody` by default. Each policy group
also has several *properties*, such as `trusted` and `admin`, which
determine access conditions. A collection of identity maps or *idmaps*
are kept for each policy group. These idmaps determine how UIDs and GIDs
on the client are translated into the canonical user space of the local
Lustre file system.

In order for nodemap to function properly, the MGS, MDS, and OSS systems
must all have a version of Lustre which supports nodemap. Clients
operate transparently and do not require special configuration or
knowledge of the nodemap setup.

::: note
A nodemap name has a maximum length of 16 characters, and can contain
only alphanumeric characters and \'\_\'.
:::

### Deciding on NID Ranges

NIDs can be described as either a singleton address or a range of
addresses. A single address is described in standard Lustre NID format,
such as `10.10.6.120@tcp`. A range is described using a dash to separate
the range, for example, `192.168.20.[0-255]@tcp`.

The range must be contiguous. The full LNet definition for a nidlist is
as follows:

    <nidlist>       :== <nidrange> [ ' ' <nidrange> ]
    <nidrange>      :== <addrrange> '@' <net>
    <addrrange>     :== '*' |
                            <ipaddr_range> |
                            <numaddr_range>
    <ipaddr_range>  :==
            <numaddr_range>.<numaddr_range>.<numaddr_range>.<numaddr_range>
    <numaddr_range> :== <number> |
                            <expr_list>
    <expr_list>     :== '[' <range_expr> [ ',' <range_expr>] ']'
    <range_expr>    :== <number> |
                            <number> '-' <number> |
                            <number> '-' <number> '/' <number>
    <net>           :== <netname> | <netname><number>
    <netname>       :== "lo" | "tcp" | "o2ib" | "gni"
    <number>        :== <nonnegative decimal> | <hexadecimal>

### Defining a Servers Specific Group

For proper operations, the Lustre file system **requires** to have a
privileged group that covers all Lustre server nodes. So the very first
step when working with nodemaps is to create such a group with both
properties `admin` and `trusted` set. It is recommended to give this
group an explicit label such as `TrustedSystem` or some identifier that
makes the association clear.

Let\'s consider a deployment where the server nodes are in the NID range
`192.168.0.[1-10]@tcp`. Create the policy group, add the NID range to
that group, and set the properties accordingly using the `lctl` command
on the MGS:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_add TrustedSystems
    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_range --name TrustedSystems --range 192.168.0.[1-10]@tcp
    mgs# lctl nodemap_modify --name TrustedSystems --property admin --value 1
    mgs# lctl nodemap_modify --name TrustedSystems --property trusted --value 1

### Describing and Deploying a Sample Mapping

Deploy nodemap by first considering which users need to be mapped, and
what sets of network addresses or ranges are involved. Issues of
visibility between users must be examined as well.

Consider a deployment where researchers are working on data relating to
birds. The researchers use a computing system which mounts the
filesystem from a single IPv4 address, `192.168.0.100`, and sensors
which mount the filesystem from an address range `192.168.0.[50-99]`.
Name this policy group `BirdResearchSite`. Create the policy group and
add the NID ranges to that group on the MGS using the `lctl` command:

            mgs# lctl nodemap_add BirdResearchSite
            mgs# lctl nodemap_add_range --name BirdResearchSite --range 192.168.0.100@tcp
            mgs# lctl nodemap_add_range --name BirdResearchSite --range 192.168.0.[50-99]@tcp
          

Later, additional sensors were added that use addresses in the range
`192.168.10.[101-150]` that increased the number of nodes in the
`BirdResearchSite` nodemap, but otherwise are managed as part of the
same nodemap.

            mgs# lctl nodemap_add_range --name BirdResearchSite --range 192.168.0.[101-150]@tcp
          

::: note
A NID cannot be in more than one policy group. Assign a NID to a new
policy group by first removing it from the existing group.
:::

The researchers use the following identifiers on their host system:

-   `swan` (UID 530) member of group `wetlands` (GID 600)

-   `duck` (UID 531) member of group `wetlands` (GID 600)

-   `hawk` (UID 532) member of group `raptor` (GID 601)

-   `merlin` (UID 533) member of group `raptor` (GID 601)

Assign a set of six idmaps to this policy group, with four for UIDs, and
two for GIDs. Pick a starting point, e.g. UID 11000, with room for
additional UIDs and GIDs to be added as the configuration grows. Use the
`lctl` command to set up the idmaps:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_idmap --name BirdResearchSite --idtype uid --idmap 530:11000
    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_idmap --name BirdResearchSite --idtype uid --idmap 531:11001
    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_idmap --name BirdResearchSite --idtype uid --idmap 532:11002
    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_idmap --name BirdResearchSite --idtype uid --idmap 533:11003
    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_idmap --name BirdResearchSite --idtype gid --idmap 600:11000
    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_idmap --name BirdResearchSite --idtype gid --idmap 601:11001

The parameter `530:11000` assigns a client UID, for example UID 530, to
a single canonical UID, such as UID 11000. Each assignment is made
individually. There is no method to specify a range
`530-533:11000-11003`. UID and GID idmaps are assigned separately. There
is no implied relationship between the two.

Files created on the Lustre file system from the `192.168.0.100@tcp` NID
using UID `duck` and GID `wetlands` are stored in the Lustre file system
using the canonical identifiers, in this case UID 11001 and GID 11000. A
different NID, if not part of the same policy group, sees its own view
of the same file space.

Suppose a previously created project directory exists owned by UID
11002/GID 11001, with mode 770. When users `hawk` and `merlin` at
192.168.0.100 place files named `hawk-file` and `merlin-file` into the
directory, the contents from the 192.168.0.100 client appear as:

    [merlin@192.168.0.100 projectsite]$ ls -la
    total 34520
    drwxrwx--- 2 hawk   raptor     4096 Jul 23 09:06 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 nobody nobody     4096 Jul 23 09:02 ..
    -rw-r--r-- 1 hawk   raptor 10240000 Jul 23 09:05 hawk-file
    -rw-r--r-- 1 merlin raptor 25100288 Jul 23 09:06 merlin-file

From a privileged view, the canonical owners are displayed:

    [root@trustedSite projectsite]# ls -la
    total 34520
    drwxrwx--- 2 11002 11001     4096 Jul 23 09:06 .
    drwxr-xr-x 3 root root     4096 Jul 23 09:02 ..
    -rw-r--r-- 1 11002 11001 10240000 Jul 23 09:05 hawk-file
    -rw-r--r-- 1 11003 11001 25100288 Jul 23 09:06 merlin-file

If UID 11002 or GID 11001 do not exist on the Lustre MDS or MGS, create
them in LDAP or other data sources, or trust clients by setting
`identity_upcall` to `NONE`. For more information, see
[???](#identity_upcall).

Building a larger and more complex configuration is possible by
iterating through the `lctl` commands above. In short:

1.  Create a name for the policy group.

2.  Create a set of NID ranges used by the group.

3.  Define which UID and GID translations need to occur for the group.

### Mapping Project IDs

Like UIDs and GIDs, PROJIDs can be mapped via nodemaps, from client to
file system IDs and conversely. To declare a PROJID mapping, use the
`projid` type:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_idmap --name BirdResearchSite --idtype projid --idmap 33:1

### Defining Mapping Offsets

Mapping offsets map all client ids to a new range specified by an
offset, such that fs_id = client_id + offset. The `nodemap_add_offset`
command defines a mapping offset for a given nodemap and applies the
offset to all UID, GID, and PROJID types.

    lctl nodemap add_offset --name NAME --offset OFFSET --limit FSID_COUNT

This command allows admins to create offset ranges for client systems to
avoid overlapping assignments in multi-tenant systems. The `FSID_COUNT`
specifies the number of IDs mapped by the range, starting with the
`root(0)` user/group/project ID and extending through `FSID_COUNT-1`.

An offset range cannot overlap with another offset range. A nodemap can
only have one offset defined. To modify the offset already defined, just
assign a new value. Any existing files will not automatically be
remapped to the new `OFFSET` range. IDs must be manually changed on all
files for that nodemap with `chown(1)` and `lfs-project(1)` on a trusted
client that has access to the unmapped, canonical file system IDs.
Therefore modifying a nodemap offset should be avoided if possible.

For example, to map the client UID, GID, and PROJID values from the
range 0-199999 to the filesystem UID, GID, and PROJID values to the
range 100000-299999:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_add_offset --name remotesite --offset 100000 --limit 200000

Once an offset is set on a nodemap, please make sure the explicit
mappings are defined so that they do not escape the offset range. This
means an explicit mapping should not map a client id to a file system id
greater than `FSID_COUNT-1`. Similarly, the `squash_uid`, `squash_gid`
and `squash_projid` values should not be set to a value greater than
`FSID_COUNT-1`. Otherwise this would produce file system ids outside of
the offset range.

If not zero, the mapping offset is always applied as the last stage of
the mapping process. [Flow chart: nodemap identity
mapping](#settingamapping.fig.id_mapping_flow_chart) gives a simplified
view of the identity mapping process that happens when nodemap is
activated, to convert a client id to a file system canonical id.

![Flow chart: nodemap identity
mapping](figures/id_mapping_flow_chart.png){#settingamapping.fig.id_mapping_flow_chart
width="65%"}

To deactivate id mapping offset, use the `nodemap_del_offset` command.

    lctl nodemap del_offset --name NAME

::: note
As when changing the ID offset value, deleting the ID offset *will not
remap files created with the offset IDs*. It is up to the storage
administrator to delete or reset UID/GID/PROJID for files that were
created with the mapped IDs. Generally, an ID offset should remain
unchanged for the entire nodemap lifetime and not be deleted without a
clear understanding of the operational impact.
:::

## Removing Nodemaps {#nodemapdel}

It is possible to delete a NID range from a nodemap, any clients in this
NID range will be moved to the default nodemap.

    mgs# lctl nodemap_del_range --name BirdResearchSite --range 192.168.0.[101-150]@tcp

When deleting a range from a nodemap it must be the same range that was
declared when using nodemap_add_range. This means that it is not
possible to remove a range inside of the initial values or a (partially)
overlapping range. Also worth noting, if two different ranges are added
that are adjacent, they are still treated as two independent ranges and
must be each individually deleted.

When deleting a whole policy group all of the associated ID mappings,
NID ranges, and other parameters will be removed, and existing clients
will be moved to the default nodemap. The default nodemap cannot be
deleted. The syntax is:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_del BirdResearchSite

## Altering Properties {#alteringproperties}

Privileged users access mapped systems with rights dependent on certain
properties, described below. By default, root access is squashed to user
`nobody`, which interferes with most administrative actions.

For proper operations, the Lustre file system **requires** a group that
covers all Lustre server nodes, with both properties `admin` and
`trusted` set. It is recommended to give this group an explicit label
such as `TrustedSystems` or some identifier that makes the association
clear.

### Managing the Properties {#lustrenodemap.alteringproperties.managing}

Several properties exist, off by default, which change client behavior:
`admin`, `trusted`, `map_mode`, `squash_uid`, `squash_gid`,
`squash_projid`, `deny_unknown`, `audit_mode` and `forbid_encryption`.

-   The property `admin` defines whether root is squashed on the policy
    group. By default, it is squashed, unless this property is enabled.
    Coupled with the `trusted` property, this will allow unmapped access
    for backup nodes, transfer points, or other administrative mount
    points.

-   The `trusted` property permits members of a policy group to see the
    file system\'s canonical identifiers. In the above example, UID
    11002 and GID 11001 will be seen without translation. This can be
    utilized when local UID and GID sets already map directly to the
    specified users.

-   The `map_mode` property lets control the way mapping is carried out.
    By default it is set to `all` which means the nodemap will map UIDs,
    GIDs, and PROJIDs. If set to `uid_only` or just `uid`, only UIDs
    will be mapped. If set to `gid_only` or just `gid`, only GIDs will
    be mapped. If set to `projid_only` or just `projid`, only PROJIDs
    will be mapped. If set to `both`, both UIDs and GIDs will be mapped.
    Multiple values can be specified, comma separated.

-   The properties `squash_uid`, `squash_gid` and `squash_projid` define
    the default UID, GID and PROJID respectively that users will be
    squashed to if unmapped, unless the deny_unknown flag is set, in
    which case access will still be denied.

    ::: note
    The `squash_projid` property was introduced in Lustre 2.15
    :::

-   The property `deny_unknown` denies all access to users not mapped in
    a particular nodemap. This is useful if a site is concerned about
    unmapped users accessing the file system in order to satisfy
    security requirements.

-   The property `audit_mode` lets control which Lustre client nodes can
    trigger the recording of file system access events to the
    Changelogs. When this flag is set to 1, clients will be able to
    record file system access events to the Changelogs, if Changelogs
    are otherwise activated. When set to 0, events are not logged into
    the Changelogs, no matter if Changelogs are activated or not. By
    default, this flag is set to 1 in newly created nodemap entries. And
    it is also set to 1 in \'default\' nodemap.

-   The property `forbid_encryption` prevents clients from using
    encryption.

-   The property `readonly_mount` forces clients to a read-only mount if
    not specified explicitly. By default it is set to 0 which means
    clients are allowed to mount in read-write mode. Set it to 1 to
    force read-only mount.

-   The property `rbac` defines different Role-Based Admin Control
    mechanisms:

    -   `byfid_ops`, to allow operations by FID (e.g. \'lfs rmfid\').

    -   `chlg_ops`, to allow access to Lustre Changelogs.

    -   `dne_ops`, to allow operations related to DNE (e.g. \'lfs
        mkdir\').

    -   `file_perms`, to allow modifications of file permissions and
        owners.

    -   `fscrypt_admin`, to allow fscrypt related admin tasks (create or
        modify protectors/policies). Note that even without this role,
        it is still possible to lock or unlock encrypted directories, as
        these operations only need read access to fscrypt metadata.

    -   `quota_ops`, to allow quota modifications.

    The default value for this property is `all`, which means all roles
    are allowed. Multiple values among those listed above can be
    specified, comma separated. Apart from all, any role not explicitly
    specified is forbidden. And to forbid all roles, use `none` value.

-   The property `deny_mount` controls whether nodes assigned to the
    nodemap are allowed to mount new Lustre clients. By default this is
    allowed and the property is set to 0. Set it to 1 to prevent nodes
    from establishing new client mounts. Note that existing client
    mounts are not evicted and will continue to work until a remount is
    attempted.

Alter values to either true (1) or false (0) on the MGS:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_modify --name BirdAdminSite --property trusted --value 1
    mgs# lctl nodemap_modify --name BirdAdminSite --property admin --value 1
    mgs# lctl nodemap_modify --name BirdAdminSite --property deny_unknown --value 1

Change values during system downtime to minimize the chance of any
ownership or permissions problems if the policy group is active.
Although changes can be made live, client caching of data may interfere
with modification as there are a few seconds of lead time before the
change is distributed.

### Mixing Properties {#lustrenodemap.alteringproperties.mixing}

With both `admin` and `trusted` properties set, the policy group has
full access, as if nodemap was turned off, to the Lustre file system.
The administrative site for the Lustre file system needs at least one
group with both properties in order to perform maintenance or to perform
administrative tasks.

::: warning
Lustre server nodes **must** be in a policy group with both these
properties set to 1. It is recommended to use a policy group labeled
`TrustedSystems` or some identifier that makes the association clear.
:::

If a policy group has the `admin` property set, but does not have the
property `trusted` set, root is mapped directly to root, any explicitly
specified UID and GID idmaps are honored, and other access is squashed.
If root alters ownership to UIDs or GIDs which are locally known from
that host but not part of an idmap, root effectively changes ownership
of those files to the default squashed UID and GID.

If `trusted` is set but `admin` is not, the policy group has full access
to the canonical UID and GID sets of the Lustre file system, and root is
squashed.

The deny_unknown property, once enabled, prevents unmapped users from
accessing the file system. Root access also is denied, if the `admin`
property is off, and root is not part of any mapping.

To prevent a client from changing quota settings for a project other
than the one assigned to the fileset it is restricted to, you should map
the PROJID to itself, set `map_mode` to `projid`, and then `trusted` to
0 and `deny_unknown` to 1. This way, only operations on the designated
PROJID will be allowed.

When nodemaps are modified, the change events are queued and distributed
across the cluster. Under normal conditions, these changes can take
around ten seconds to propagate. During this distribution window, file
access could be made via the old or new nodemap settings. Therefore, it
is recommended to save changes for a maintenance window or to deploy
them while the mapped nodes are not actively writing to the file system.

## Enabling the Feature {#enablingthefeature}

The nodemap feature is simple to enable:

    mgs# lctl nodemap_activate 1

Passing the parameter 0 instead of 1 disables the feature again. After
deploying the feature, validate the mappings are intact before offering
the file system to be mounted by clients.

So far, changes have been made on the MGS. Prior to Lustre 2.9, changes
must also be manually set on MDS systems as well. Also, changes must be
manually deployed to OSS servers if quota is enforced, utilizing
`lctl set_param` instead of `lctl`. Prior to 2.9, the configuration is
not persistent, requiring a script which generates the mapping to be
saved and deployed after every Lustre restart. As an example, use this
style to deploy settings on the OSS:

    oss# lctl set_param nodemap.add_nodemap=SiteName
    oss# lctl set_param nodemap.add_nodemap_range='SiteName 192.168.0.15@tcp'
    oss# lctl set_param nodemap.add_nodemap_idmap='SiteName uid 510:1700'
    oss# lctl set_param nodemap.add_nodemap_idmap='SiteName gid 612:1702'

In Lustre 2.9 and later, nodemap configuration is saved on the MGS and
distributed automatically to MGS, MDS, and OSS nodes, a process which
takes approximately ten seconds in normal circumstances.

## `default` Nodemap {#defaultNodemap}

There is a special nodemap called `default`. As the name suggests, it is
created by default and cannot be removed. It is like a fallback nodemap,
setting the behaviour for Lustre clients that do not match any other
nodemap.

Because of its special role, only some parameters can be set on the
`default` nodemap:

-   `admin`

-   `trusted`

-   `squash_uid`

-   `squash_gid`

-   `fileset`

-   `audit_mode`

In particular, no UID/GID mapping can be defined on the `default`
nodemap.

::: note
Be careful when altering the `admin` and `trusted` properties of the
`default` nodemap, especially if your Lustre servers fall into this
nodemap.
:::

## Verifying Settings {#verifyingsettings}

By using `lctl nodemap_info all`, existing nodemap configuration is
listed for easy export. This command acts as a shortcut into the
configuration interface for nodemap. On the Lustre MGS, the
`nodemap.active` parameter contains a `1` if nodemap is active on the
system. Each policy group creates a directory containing the following
parameters:

-   `admin` and `trusted` each contain a `1` if the values are set, and
    `0` otherwise.

-   `idmap` contains a list of the idmaps for the policy group, while
    `ranges` contains a list of NIDs for the group.

-   `squash_uid` and `squash_gid` determine what UID and GID users are
    squashed to if needed.

The expected outputs for the BirdResearchSite in the example above are:

    mgs# lctl get_param nodemap.BirdResearchSite.idmap

     [
      { idtype: uid, client_id: 530, fs_id: 11000 },
      { idtype: uid, client_id: 531, fs_id: 11001 },
      { idtype: uid, client_id: 532, fs_id: 11002 },
      { idtype: uid, client_id: 533, fs_id: 11003 },
      { idtype: gid, client_id: 600, fs_id: 11000 },
      { idtype: gid, client_id: 601, fs_id: 11001 }
     ]

     mgs# lctl get_param nodemap.BirdResearchSite.ranges
     [
      { id: 11, start_nid: 192.168.0.100@tcp, end_nid: 192.168.0.100@tcp }
     ]

## Ensuring Consistency {#ensuringconsistency}

Consistency issues may arise in a nodemap enabled configuration when
Lustre clients mount from an unknown NID range, new UIDs and GIDs that
were not part of a known map are added, or there are misconfigurations
in the rules. Keep in mind the following when activating nodemap on a
production system:

-   Creating new policy groups or idmaps on a production system is
    allowed, but reserve a maintenance window to alter the `trusted`
    property to avoid metadata problems.

-   To perform administrative tasks, access the Lustre file system via a
    policy group with `trusted` and `admin` properties set. This
    prevents the creation of orphaned and squashed files. Granting the
    `admin` property without the `trusted` property is dangerous. The
    root user on the client may know of UIDs and GIDs that are not
    present in any idmap. If root alters ownership to those identifiers,
    the ownership is squashed as a result. For example, tar file
    extracts may be flipped from an expected UID such as UID 500 to
    `nobody`, normally UID 99.

-   To map distinct UIDs at two or more sites onto a single UID or GID
    on the Lustre file system, create overlapping idmaps and place each
    site in its own policy group. Each distinct UID may have its own
    mapping onto the target UID or GID.

-   In Lustre 2.8, changes must be manually kept in a script file to be
    re-applied after a Lustre reload, and changes must be made on each
    OSS, MDS, and MGS nodes, as there is no automatic synchronization
    between the nodes.

-   If `deny_unknown` is in effect, it is possible for unmapped users to
    see dentries which were viewed by a mapped user. This is a result of
    client caching, and unmapped users will not be able to view any file
    contents.

-   Nodemap activation status can be checked with `lctl nodemap_info`,
    but extra validation is possible. One way of ensuring valid
    deployment on a production system is to create a fingerprint of
    known files with specific UIDs and GIDs mapped to a test client.
    After bringing the Lustre system online after maintenance, the test
    client can validate the UIDs and GIDs map correctly before the
    system is mounted in user space.
