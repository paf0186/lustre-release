# Programming Interfaces {#lustreprogramminginterfaces}

This chapter describes public programming interfaces to that can be used
to control various aspects of a Lustre file system from userspace. This
chapter includes the following sections:

-   [User/Group Upcall](#identity_upcall)

-   [Data Structures](#perm_downcall_data)

## []{.indexterm primary="programming" secondary="upcall"}User/Group Upcall {#identity_upcall}

This section describes the supplementary user/group upcall, which allows
the MDS to retrieve and verify the supplementary groups to which a
particular user is assigned. This avoids the need to pass all the
supplementary groups from the client to the MDS with every RPC.

system environment, see [???](#section_rh2_d4w_gk).

### Synopsis

The MDS uses the utility as specified by
`lctl get_param mdt.${FSNAME}-MDT{xxxx}.identity_upcall` to look up the
supplied UID in order to retrieve the user\'s supplementary group
membership. The result is temporarily cached in the kernel (for five
minutes, by default) to avoid the overhead of calling into userspace
repeatedly.

### Description

The `identity_upcall` parameter contains the path to an executable that
is run to map a numeric UID to a group membership list. This upcall
executable opens the `mdt.${FSNAME}-MDT{xxxx}.identity_info` parameter
file and writes the related `identity_downcall_data` data structure (see
[Data Structures](#perm_downcall_data)). The upcall is configured with
`lctl set_param mdt.${FSNAME}-MDT{xxxx}.identity_upcall`.

The default identity upcall program installed is
`lustre/utils/l_getidentity.c` in the Lustre source distribution.

#### Primary and Secondary Groups

The mechanism for the primary/secondary group is as follows:

-   The MDS issues an upcall (set per MDS) to map the numeric UID to the
    supplementary group(s).

-   If there is no upcall or if there is an upcall and it fails, one
    supplementary group at most will be added as supplied by the client.

-   The default upcall `/usr/sbin/l_getidentity` can interact with the
    user/group database on the MDS to map the UID to the GID and
    supplementary GID. The user/group database depends on how
    authentication is configured on the MDS, such as local
    `/etc/passwd`, Network Information Service (NIS), Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), or SMB Domain services, as
    configured. If the upcall interface is set to NONE, then upcall is
    disabled, and the MDS uses only the UID, GID, and one supplementary
    GID supplied by the client.

-   The MDS will wait a limited time for the group upcall program to
    complete, to avoid MDS threads and clients hanging due to errors
    accessing a remote service node. The upcall must finish within 30s
    before the MDS will continue without the supplementary data. The
    upcall timeout in seconds can be set on the MDS using:
    `lctl set_param mdt.*.identity_acquire_expire=seconds`

-   The default group upcall is set permanently by `mkfs.lustre`. To set
    a custom upcall for a particular filesystem, use
    `tunefs.lustre --param` or
    `lctl set_param -P mdt.FSNAME-MDTxxxx.identity_upcall=path`

-   The group downcall data is cached by the kernel to avoid repeated
    upcalls for the same user slowing down the MDS. This cache is
    expired from the kernel after 1200s (20 minutes) by default. The
    cache age in seconds can be set on the MDS using:
    `lctl set_param mdt.*.identity_expire=seconds`

-   To force eviction of cached identity data (e.g. after adding or
    removing a user from a supplementary group), the cache entry for a
    specific numeric UID can be flushed on the MDS using:
    `lctl set_param mdt.*.identity_flush=UID` To flush the cached
    records for all users from cache, use `-1` for the UID:
    `lctl set_param mdt.*.identity_flush=-1`
