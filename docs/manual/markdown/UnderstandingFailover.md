## []{.indexterm primary="failover"}What is Failover? {#what_is_failover}

In a high-availability (HA) system, unscheduled downtime is minimized by
using redundant hardware and software components and software components
that automate recovery when a failure occurs. If a failure condition
occurs, such as the loss of a server or storage device or a network or
software fault, the system\'s services continue with minimal
interruption. Generally, availability is specified as the percentage of
time the system is required to be available.

Availability is accomplished by replicating hardware and/or software so
that when a primary server fails or is unavailable, a standby server can
be switched into its place to run applications and associated resources.
This process, called *failover*, is automatic in an HA system and, in
most cases, completely application-transparent.

A failover hardware setup requires a pair of servers with a shared
resource (typically a physical storage device, which may be based on
SAN, NAS, hardware RAID, SCSI or Fibre Channel (FC) technology). The
method of sharing storage should be essentially transparent at the
device level; the same physical logical unit number (LUN) should be
visible from both servers. To ensure high availability at the physical
storage level, we encourage the use of RAID arrays to protect against
drive-level failures.

::: note
The Lustre software does not provide redundancy for data; it depends
exclusively on redundancy of backing storage devices. The backing OST
storage should be RAID 5 or, preferably, RAID 6 storage. MDT storage
should be RAID 1 or RAID 10.

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="capabilities"}Failover Capabilities

To establish a highly-available Lustre file system, power management
software or hardware and high availability (HA) software are used to
provide the following failover capabilities:

-   **Resource fencing**- Protects physical storage from simultaneous
    access by two nodes.

-   **Resource management**- Starts and stops the Lustre resources as a
    part of failover, maintains the cluster state, and carries out other
    resource management tasks.

-   **Health monitoring**- Verifies the availability of hardware and
    network resources and responds to health indications provided by the
    Lustre software.

These capabilities can be provided by a variety of software and/or
hardware solutions. For more information about using power management
software or hardware and high availability (HA) software with a Lustre
file system, see [???](#configuringfailover).

HA software is responsible for detecting failure of the primary Lustre
server node and controlling the failover.The Lustre software works with
any HA software that includes resource (I/O) fencing. For proper
resource fencing, the HA software must be able to completely power off
the failed server or disconnect it from the shared storage device. If
two active nodes have access to the same storage device, data may be
severely corrupted.

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="configuration"}Types of Failover Configurations

Nodes in a cluster can be configured for failover in several ways. They
are often configured in pairs (for example, two OSTs attached to a
shared storage device), but other failover configurations are also
possible. Failover configurations include:

-   **Active/passive** pair - In this configuration, the active node
    provides resources and serves data, while the passive node is
    usually standing by idle. If the active node fails, the passive node
    takes over and becomes active.

-   **Active/active** pair - In this configuration, both nodes are
    active, each providing a subset of resources. In case of a failure,
    the second node takes over resources from the failed node.

If there is a single MDT in a filesystem, two MDSes can be configured as
an active/passive pair, while pairs of OSSes can be deployed in an
active/active configuration that improves OST availability without extra
overhead. Often the standby MDS is the active MDS for another Lustre
file system or the MGS, so no nodes are idle in the cluster. If there
are multiple MDTs in a filesystem, active-active failover configurations
are available for MDSs that serve MDTs on shared storage.

## []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="and Lustre"}Failover Functionality in a Lustre File System {#failover_functionality}

The failover functionality provided by the Lustre software can be used
for the following failover scenario. When a client attempts to do I/O to
a failed Lustre target, it continues to try until it receives an answer
from any of the configured failover nodes for the Lustre target. A
user-space application does not detect anything unusual, except that the
I/O may take longer to complete.

Failover in a Lustre file system requires that two nodes be configured
as a failover pair, which must share one or more storage devices. A
Lustre file system can be configured to provide MDT or OST failover.

-   For MDT failover, two MDSs can be configured to serve the same MDT.
    Only one MDS node can serve any MDT at one time. By placing two or
    more MDT devices on storage shared by two MDSs, one MDS can fail and
    the remaining MDS can begin serving the unserved MDT. This is
    described as an active/active failover pair.

-   For OST failover, multiple OSS nodes can be configured to be able to
    serve the same OST. However, only one OSS node can serve the OST at
    a time. An OST can be moved between OSS nodes that have access to
    the same storage device using `umount/mount` commands.

The `--servicenode` option is used to set up nodes in a Lustre file
system for failover at creation time (using `mkfs.lustre`) or later when
the Lustre file system is active (using `tunefs.lustre`). For
explanations of these utilities, see [???](#mkfs.lustre)and
[???](#tunefs.lustre).

Failover capability in a Lustre file system can be used to upgrade the
Lustre software between successive minor versions without cluster
downtime. For more information, see [???](#upgradinglustre).

For information about configuring failover, see
[???](#configuringfailover).

::: note
The Lustre software provides failover functionality only at the file
system level. In a complete failover solution, failover functionality
for system-level components, such as node failure detection or power
control, must be provided by a third-party tool.
:::

::: caution
OST failover functionality does not protect against corruption caused by
a disk failure. If the storage media (i.e., physical disk) used for an
OST fails, it cannot be recovered by functionality provided in the
Lustre software. We strongly recommend that some form of RAID be used
for OSTs. Lustre functionality assumes that the storage is reliable, so
it adds no extra reliability features.

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="MDT"}MDT Failover Configuration (Active/Passive)

Two MDSs are typically configured as an active/passive failover pair as
shown in [Lustre failover configuration for a active/passive
MDT](#understandingfailover.fig.configmdt). Note that both nodes must
have access to shared storage for the MDT(s) and the MGS. The primary
(active) MDS manages the Lustre system metadata resources. If the
primary MDS fails, the secondary (passive) MDS takes over these
resources and serves the MDTs and the MGS.

::: note
In an environment with multiple file systems, the MDSs can be configured
in a quasi active/active configuration, with each MDS managing metadata
for a subset of the Lustre file system.

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="MDT"}MDT Failover Configuration (Active/Active) {#mdtactiveactive}

MDTs can be configured as an active/active failover configuration. A
failover cluster is built from two MDSs as shown in [Lustre failover
configuration for a active/active
MDTs](#understandingfailover.fig.configmdts).

### []{.indexterm primary="failover" secondary="OST"}OST Failover Configuration (Active/Active)

OSTs are usually configured in a load-balanced, active/active failover
configuration. A failover cluster is built from two OSSs as shown in
[Lustre failover configuration for an
OSTs](#understandingfailover.fig.configost).

::: note
OSSs configured as a failover pair must have shared disks/RAID.
:::

![Lustre failover configuration for an
OSTs](./figures/OST_Failover.png){#understandingfailover.fig.configost
width="100%"}

In an active configuration, 50% of the available OSTs are assigned to
one OSS and the remaining OSTs are assigned to the other OSS. Each OSS
serves as the primary node for half the OSTs and as a failover node for
the remaining OSTs.

In this mode, if one OSS fails, the other OSS takes over all of the
failed OSTs. The clients attempt to connect to each OSS serving the OST,
until one of them responds. Data on the OST is written synchronously,
and the clients replay transactions that were in progress and
uncommitted to disk before the OST failure.
